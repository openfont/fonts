  "description": "Azeret Mono is a monospaced typeface with a mono-linear character. The story of the typeface began with a draft that was driven by an exploration of OCR fonts, past and futuristic operating systems, various interfaces and the nineties. The final result is more based on a desire to achieve an appearance of the typeface that could serve in operating systems. Thus the overall character is a conjunction of everything described with details that evoke a specific personality. Azeret is designed by Martin Vácha and Daniel Quisek.

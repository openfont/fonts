  "description": "The Soft Type Collection is designed for knitters to chart out their typographic projects. Jacquarda Bastarda is an expanded revival typeface from a bastarda-esque Victorian needlepoint alphabet designed in Berlin by Heinrich Kuehn circa 1880. Each typeface has a “Regular” and “Charted” version, and some include multiple scales so you can fit type on your knits, no matter the project's size. Check out the charted version Jacquarda Bastarda 9 Charted . In this collection, the number following the typeface's name indicates the height of the capital letters for that typeface.

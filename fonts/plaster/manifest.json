  "description": "Foundry: Sorkin Type Co Plaster is a very low contrast extremely geometric design done in the tradition of the work of Joseph Albers. However many of the solutions to the glyph design vary from Alber's choices. Plaster is suitable for use in medium to large sizes including headlines. This font deviates from most similar fonts because the space between letters is larger. The gaps in the stencil style letters makes letter identification more difficult. A wider letter space helps make the letters easy to read again. Source files are available from Google Code . To contribute to the project contact Eben Sorkin .",

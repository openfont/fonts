  "description": "Inria Sans and Inria Serif are the two members of a type family design for the communication of Inria, a national institute dedicated to numeric research. The Institute needed a font showing its values at the crossroad of humanity, technology, excellence and creativity. Black[Foundry] created a humanist typeface with a unapologetically contemporary design as the Sans-Serif part and a more rational drawing for the Serif. Both members come in 3 weights with matching Italics. To contribute, see github.com/BlackFoundryCom/InriaFonts .",

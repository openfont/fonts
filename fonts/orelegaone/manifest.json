  "description": "Orelega is a whimsical Clarendon font with oversized ears. Its design was based on Sagona Extra Bold by René Bieder, but it is not a shameless copy. Everything has been redrawn from the ground up, with many new aesthetic changes. Orelega is Esperanto for “large-eared”. It is composed of orel- “ear”, -eg- [augments degree or size], and -a [adjective ending]. To contribute, see github.com/JapanYoshi/Orelega",

  "description": "Kelly Slab is a new geometric, modern-looking slab-serif font. Created under the influence of popular geometric fonts from the 1930s with square slabserifs, such as \"City\" by Georg Trump. It is designed for attention and impact in advertising, headings, major labels and logotypes. It can also work well in larger point size text blocks. Its unusual shapes provide an interesting rhythm to the textline, a distinctive, rectangular design that can give a sporty, urban feeling.",

  "description": "Kite One is a rounded, monoline, humanist sans serif typeface. With an inclination of 7 degrees, it gives a fluid reading experience. Long ascenders and descenders, soft shapes, open counterforms and soft terminals, make Kite One a typeface that is very suitable for long texts, especially those associated with the natural world or children’s tales. The February 2023 update features a bigger glyphset, fractions and some minor aesthetic modifications. To contribute, see github.com/etunni/Kite-One .",

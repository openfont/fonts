  "description": "Braah is a display font that perfectly blends boldness and playfulness. The font is available with corresponding Latin/Gurmukhi scripts, making it versatile and adaptable to different languages. Braah was designed by India-based typeface and UX designer Ashish Kumar. An update in May 2023 corrects the original vertical metrics, which may impact line spacing in some layouts. To contribute to the project please see github.com/artandtype/Braah .",

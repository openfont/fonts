  "description": "Inspired by the lettering popular in the northwest United States in the 1980s, My Soul is a flat pen calligraphic style with capital forms that have been subtly embellished. It's robust weight holds up well at reduced sizes, but be careful as the embellishments may cause a loss of legibility at such sizes. It comes with Latin Character sets including Western, Central, and Vietnamese language support. To contribute, see github.com/googlefonts/my-soul .",

  "description": "Fenix is a serif typeface designed for use in both display and long text. Very inspired by calligraphy, it has strong serifs and rough strokes. Its proportions are designed to gain space savings in text, both in height and width. It is elegant at large sizes and legible at the same time, with a lot of rhythm in small sizes.",

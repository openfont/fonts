  "description": "The peculiarity of this typography lies in its curved structures and strokes, which are developed on it by getting thinner and sharper as if they were being typed using a metallic and bevel-edged point. The visual mark characteristic of Julee is a casual cursive-like type, yet balanced due to the tidy proportions of its signs. The March 2023 update features a bigger glyphset, fractions and some minor aesthetic modifications. More documentation can be found at www.tipo.net.ar To contribute, see github.com/etunni/julee .",

  "description": "The Soft Type Collection is designed for knitters to chart out their typographic projects. Micro 5 is a teeny-tiny typeface that can fit anywhere on your project. Each typeface has a “Regular” and “Charted” version, and some include multiple scales so you can fit type on your knits, no matter the project's size. In this collection, the number following the typeface's name indicates the height of the capital letters for that typeface. Check out the non-charted version Micro 5 .

  "description": "Coiny is a typeface designed originally for the Latin and Tamil scripts in parallel. Naturally bold, and born on street to shine on screen. It has a structure based on simple geometrical shapes, and is inspired by the vernacular designs seen around every big city. The forms are similar to those found with writing made with a rounded brush point. It is a lot of fun for titles and headlines. The Coiny project is led by Marcelo Magalhães, a type designer based in São Paulo, Brasil. To contribute, see github.com/marcelommp/Coiny",

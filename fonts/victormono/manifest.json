  "description": "Victor Mono is a monospaced font with optional semi-connected cursive italics and programming symbol ligatures. The typeface is slender, crisp and narrow, with a large x-height and clear punctuation, making it legible and ideal for code. The typeface was created to meet specific requirements for code and programming: narrow enough to fit a lot of text wide enough to be scannable strict, geometric and readable regular style more friendly and flowing italics programming symbol ligatures To contribute, see github.com/rubjo/victor-mono-font",

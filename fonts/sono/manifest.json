  "description": "Sono is a soft monospace (or proportional!) variable font. It has seven weights: ExtraLight through ExtraBold. The default style is fixed-width (and obviously not kerned), but thanks to the \"mono\" axis, you can add kerning and make the design proportional. To contribute, see github.com/sursly/sono .",

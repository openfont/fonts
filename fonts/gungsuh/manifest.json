It is derived from handwritten calligraphy and is more suitable for shorter text strings or display applications than long-form text. This version includes proportional Latin characters. For a version with monospace, half-width Latin characters, see GungsuhChe. To contribute to this project, please visit github.com/googlefonts/batang .",

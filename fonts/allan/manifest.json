  "description": "Once Allan was a sign painter in Berlin. Grey paneling work in the subway, bad materials, a city split in two. Now things have changed. His (character) palette of activities have expanded tremendously: he happily spends time traveling, experimenting in the gastronomic field, all kinds of festivities are no longer foreign to him. He comes with alternate features, and hints. A typeface suited for bigger sizes and display use. Truly a type that you like to see!",

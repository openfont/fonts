  "description": "A dotted version of Raleway , for posters and big headlines. It is a display face and the downloadable font features both old-style and lining numerals, standard and discretionary ligatures, as well as stylistic alternates that are inspired by more geometric sans-serif typefaces than the default which is neo-grotesque.

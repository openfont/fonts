  "description": "Bevan is a reworking of a traditional slab serif display typeface created by Heinrich Jost in the 1930s. In Bevan, Jost's earlier letter forms have been digitised and then reshaped for use as a webfont, the counters have been opened up a little and the stems optimised for use as bold display font in modern web browsers. Upgrade December 2021: an Italic style was added during the Summer of Type Program 2016, thanks to the contribution of Kalapi Gajjar-Bordawekar and Jacques Le Bailly.

  "description": "The retro look of this typeface reminds us of the metal badges used in the past to show car model names. The family name “Warnes” is the name of a street in the city of Buenos Aires where all the shops are garages selling spare parts. The February 2023 update features a bigger glyphset, fractions and some minor aesthetic modifications. To contribute, see github.com/etunni/warnes .",

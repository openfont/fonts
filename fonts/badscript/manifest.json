  "description": "Bad Script started from a simple six-letter logotype and developed into a separate font, supporting Latin and Cyrillic character sets. It was completely made using a tablet to imitate casual and neat handwriting. Designed to resemble the designer's own handwriting, while making it systematic and smooth. The 2024 update improves kerning and offers better language support. Some bugs have been fixed, and the design has been enhanced. To contribute, see github.com/alexeiva/badscript .",

  "description": "Flow is a font family built for abstracting content and code for design mockups, wireframing, presentations, and websites. It's not perfect, but neither are your wireframes. Flow has sub-pixels, artifacts, overlaps and other imperfections. Flow comes in three styles: Circular Rounded and Block . Check out danross.co/flow/ .

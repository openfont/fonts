  "description": "The Cabin Font is a humanist sans inspired by Edward Johnston’s and Eric Gill’s typefaces, with a touch of modernism. Cabin incorporates modern proportions, optical adjustments, and some elements of the geometric sans. This is the Sketch version, with the texture of a teenage doodle.",

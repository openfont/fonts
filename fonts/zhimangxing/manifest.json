  "description": "ZhiMang is a classic running script based on the handwritten calligraphy of Wei Zhimang. Running script is a semi-cursive style in which strokes within the character run together, but the characters themselves remain separated. In its singularity and richness, ZhiMang is reminiscent of works by celebrated calligrapher Wu Changshuo.",

  "description": "Big Shoulders is a superfamily of condensed American Gothic variable fonts, created for the Chicago Design System, and the citizens of Chicago. The family&apos;s tall, sans-serif forms are based in Chicago&apos;s multiple histories in railway transport, public political action, and dance. Big Shoulders is used in the Chicago Design System as the primary typeface to identify Chicago and its citizens allowing the Chicagoans to speak with one consistent typographic voice. Big Shoulders Stencil explores Chicago&apos;s histories in work and protest, and is designed to apply the Chicagoan voice to those uses. Big Shoulders Inline formalizes a local typographic vernacular for celebration, taking its hypnotic inline design from Black Chicagoans' House parties, and local LGBTQ dance events, a tradition beginning in the early 1980s.

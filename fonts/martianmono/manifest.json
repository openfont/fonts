  "description": "Martian Mono is a monospaced version of the Martian Grotesk font for code style design. It inherits Grotesk's brutal and eye-catching aesthetics as well as all of its benefits-metrics equilibrium, readability and intelligibility, and convenience for web developers and designers who believe in a systematic approach to design. Martian Mono consists of a variable font with a width (Condensed to SemiExpanded) and weight axes (Thin to ExtraBold). In January 2023, the basic Cyrillic script is added and the font supports now Ukrainian, Belarusian, and Russian languages. To contribute, see github.com/evilmartians/mono .",

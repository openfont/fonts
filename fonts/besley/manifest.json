  "description": "Besley is a antique slab serif inspired by Robert Besley's Clarendon. It features a full range of weights and matching italics, making it subtle for a variety of uses. A slight rounding of the corners gives a subtle warmth, and OpenType features such as ligatures and contextual substitutions perfect the finer details. It was made with love and will continue to improve with your support. The Besley project is designed by Owen Earl (indestructible type*).

  "description": "Foundry: Sorkin Type Co Duru Sans is low contrast a classic 20th century style sans design. Duru Sans is a new take on mixing the humanist urge with the modernist one. Duru Sans also somehow manages to be elegant and a workhorse type at the same time. Duru Sans can be used at a wide range of sizes. Source files are available from Google Code . To contribute to the project contact Eben Sorkin .",

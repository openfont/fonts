  "description": "Typearture's Nabla: an Isometric COLRv1 font Nabla is a color font inspired by isometric computer games, built using the COLRv1 format. This format allows for smooth gradients, sharp highlights and blended shadows, resulting in a bold and vibrant design. It includes two font variations axes, one for the depth of the letters, the other for the thickness of the highlight, and includes multiple color palettes. This font uses the COLRv1, CPAL and SVG tables. Please visit the gf-guide color page to learn more about Color Fonts technology.

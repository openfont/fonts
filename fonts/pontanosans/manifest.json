  "description": "Pontano Sans is a minimalist and light weighted Sans Serif. Pontano is designed mainly for use as a display font but is useable as a text font too. Pontano Sans has been designed to be used freely across the internet by web browsers on desktop computers, laptops and mobile devices. In February 2023, the font becomes variable (light to bold) and presents several improvements in terms of rendering and supported languages.

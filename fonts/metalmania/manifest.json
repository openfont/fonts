  "description": "Metal Mania was inspired by lots of Heavy Metal album covers and posters. Only the most 'Metal' elements were combined to make the quintessential Heavy Metal font. Looks good on concert posters and guitar picks! Long live Metal Mania. First drawn were the inline forms and then they were traced, utilizing a playful 'cutout' effect.

  "description": "This is a favorite of mine. A talented photography student I know was writing something down and I squealed and ran over to beg her for a sample of her writing. It was worth the effort, as I adore her style and feel it translated perfectly into a cute font. She named the font as a nod to one of her favorite bands, Jack’s Mannequin.",

  "description": "My older sister Emily and I have been inseparable best friends for years. As children, we signed notes to each other with 'Love Ya Like a Sister' and then giggled at the irony of writing that when we were, in actuality, sisters. This nerdy habit has continued for years. I created this font to honor my friendship with Emily and the many ways she has inspired me and taught me in life.",

  "description": "The Protest Types began as personal project by designer Octavio Pardo to reflect on the shapes and voices of protest signs. So far it spans four font families, each with a different voice. Protest Riot captures the shapes of naive and informal street signs. An import and novel design feature of the project as a whole:Strike, Guerrilla and Riot all share the same spacing and kerning. This means designers have the possibility to write a message, and then decide the level of passion (or anger) that they want to express that message with, without altering any line lengths or page layouts.

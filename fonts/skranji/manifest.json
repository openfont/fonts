  "description": "Like the call of Ricola being yodelled from the top of the Swiss Alps from a satisfied customer, Skranji soothes as it relieves all your design aches. Both primitive and exotic at the same time, Skranji evokes the thunder of Norse gods with the utility of a Swiss Army Knife! Designed by Dave 'Squid' Cohen of Neapolitan (a DBA of Font Diner, Inc.)",

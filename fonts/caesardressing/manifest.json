  "description": "Caesar Dressing is a 'Markers' take on a Greek alphabet. Open Window fonts gravitate towards more experimental or spontaneous renderings and this one doesn't look out of place next to the most experimental of those. It also maintains the geometric balance of a classic Greek-font quite effectively. Designed by Dathan Boardman of Open Window.",

  "description": "Kumbh Sans is a Geometric Sans Serif font envisioned to serve as a multi-purpose and workhorse font in modern web and mobile applications. The anatomy is geometric with slight contrast. The font's cap-height vs x-height ratio is kept as 3:2 for optimum legibility at any point size. After initial release in three weights, the typeface has been converted into a variable font in June 2021 with a weight axis (100 to 900). To contribute, see github.com/xconsau/KumbhSans",

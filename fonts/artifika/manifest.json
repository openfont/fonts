  "description": "Artifika is an amiable upright italic for fashionable display titling. Overall features are tender and crisp, descenders short. Settled curves are sculpted with calligraphic elegance, instrokes have a widening as a tribute to it's broad-nib origin. Nearly horizontal flat serifs support left-to-right direction, making the typeface pleasant for reading on screen. Designed by Yulya Zhdanova, Ivan Petrov in 2010-2011.

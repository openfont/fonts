  "description": "Originally inspired by the blackface Impact, it soon evolved to include numerous weights, from the Black flavor of its progenitor to a super Thin weight. The extreme weights (Thin and Black) are designed for display situations, while the remaining weights may be used for more traditional textual design applications. Alumni Sans is available in roman and italic versions. It has Latin character sets, including Western, Central, and Vietnamese language support. Alumni Sans SC is the Small Caps version of Alumni Sans . To contribute, see github.com/googlefonts/alumni .",

  "description": "Olé (named after the Spanish expression, pronounced \"oh-leh!\") has a romantic and fun flavour. Have a little fun using the ornamental glyphs to spice up any design. The Latin glyph set supports Western, Central, Eastern european languages and also Vietnamese. To contribute, see github.com/googlefonts/ole",

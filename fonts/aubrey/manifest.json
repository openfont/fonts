  "description": "Aubrey is a playful condensed decorative font with an art nouveau essence. Horizontal elements are unexpectedly cut and swapped with sloped curves creating off-beats in the overall rhythm. Spurs are added to twist and stress the movement. Aubrey can be a good choice for designing holiday decorations and greetings. Works best in medium and large sizes. Designed by Gayaneh Bagdasaryan. To contribute, see github.com/cyrealtype/Aubrey .",

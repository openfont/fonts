  "description": "Encode Sans is a versatile workhorse sans-serif superfamily ready for all kinds of typographic challenges, offering a unique blend of warmth and practicality. Its humanist aspects of simple letterforms and open apertures keep it crisp and legible, while its geometric approach of rounded letters with partially-straightened sides delivers a friendly but precise tone. It includes 5 widths from Condensed to Expanded, each with 9 weights from Light to Black. To simplify the use of smallcaps in word processors, there are also small-cap versions of each family. This project was initially designed by Pablo Impallari and Andres Torresi, refined by Jacques Le Bailly, and upgraded as a variable font by Stephen Nixon and Marc Foley.

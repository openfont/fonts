  "description": "Fruktur initially appears to be a playful and powerful black letter type with a warm friendly feeling. However its construction is closer to that of an upright italic. Fruktur offers some of the feeling of a black letter but with higher legibility and greater utility than is typical of black letter type. Fruktur will be most useful from medium to large sizes. To contribute to the project, visit github.com/EbenSorkin/Fruktur Updated: January 2016, to v1.004 with additional language support, improved hinting (visible in Windows browsers at smaller font sizes) and other minor fixes. August 2022, expanded glyph set, better language support. Italic style has been added to complement Roman.",

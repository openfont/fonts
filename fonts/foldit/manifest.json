  "description": "Foldit is a variable-gradient COLRv1 font which uses gradients to play with dimensions and give a sense of space. The concept of this design was, as the name suggests, based on a folded paper strip. This font uses the COLRv1 and CPAL tables. Please visit the gf-guide color page to learn more about Color Fonts technology. To contribute, see https://github.com/SophiaDesign/Foldit .",

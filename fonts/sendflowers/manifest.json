  "description": "Send Flowers is a mono-weight script font with clean connecting strokes and a highly legible style. It has a cute look, but since it is a cursive it has a bit more sophistication that is appropriate for an older audience. It's old school juvenile, with a delicate appeal. It comes with Latin Character sets including Western, Central, and Vietnamese language support. To contribute, see github.com/googlefonts/send-flowers .",

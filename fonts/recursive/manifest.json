  "description": "Recursive is typographic palette for UI & code. It draws inspiration from single-stroke casual, a style of brush writing used in signpainting that is stylistically flexible and warmly energetic. Recursive adapts this aesthetic basis into an extensive variable font family, designed to excel in digital interactive environments, including data-rich user interfaces, technical documentation, and code editors. Recursive offers a lot more styles than you see here! To download the full Recursive Sans &amp; Mono family, learn more about its 5 variable axes, and to configure advanced Google Fonts URL embed code for access to Recursive’s full stylistic range, check out its website at: → recursive.design The Recursive project is led by Arrow Type, a type foundry based in Brooklyn, NY, USA. To contribute, see its GitHub repo . Update, April 2021: the Google Fonts release of Recursive has been updated to incorporate various changes from its initial release. This includes fixes that correct printing issues, ensure consistent default line heights between styles on macOS, improve the handling of combining accents, add localization features for several languages, and resolve various other earlier issues.",

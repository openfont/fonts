  "description": "Fleur De Leah is a formal script with a floral flavour. One of the first fonts to incorporate embellishment design elements within the letterforms. Use it sparingly for captions and short phrases and as with any script font, but never use it in all caps. Enjoy! It comes with Latin Character sets including Western, Central, and Vietnamese language support. To contribute, see github.com/googlefonts/fleurdeleah .",

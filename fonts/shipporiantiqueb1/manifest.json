  "description": "Shippori Antique follows long-established standards for dialogue in manga and was created to provide people who draw manga in Japan a beautiful antique font for free. The Kana follow an antique, Ming Dynasty style design based on Shippori Mincho with thick lines. The Latin was designed in an old sans-serif style. Finally, the Kanji was created by modifying the SIL licensed Genseki Gothic. Shippori Antique B1 features rounded corners and ink pooling. Shippori Antique ( https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Shippori+Antique ) is the standard version of the font. To contribute to the project, visit github.com/fontdasu/ShipporiAntique",

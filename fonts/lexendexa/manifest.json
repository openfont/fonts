  "description": "Lexend is a collection of seven font families intended to improve reading proficiency. As prescription eyeglasses achieve proficiency for persons with short-sightedness, Lexend's families were developed using Shaver-Troup Formulations . All the Lexend fonts have been upgraded to variable fonts with a weight axis (from Thin to Black) in June 2021, thanks to the efforts of Font Bureau. To contribute, see github.com/googlefonts/lexend . For more information, see lexend.com .",

  "description": "Mansalva is a script font that works well for notes and informal text passages. It presents two alternates for each letter and number to provide a natural, handwritten, less mechanical look. It also features good legibility for a handwriting typeface and is perfect for a casual-looking annotation. Latest upgrade from October 2022 includes a Latin Plus language coverage currently supporting most Latin-based languages. The vertical metrics have been harmonised for a better cross-platform experience; as a result existing users may notice a visible increase of the line spacing in webpages and documents on Mac.

  "description": "Archivo is a grotesque sans serif typeface family originally designed for highlights and headlines. This family is reminiscent of late nineteenth century American typefaces. The technical and aesthetic characteristics of the font are both crafted for high performance typography. It was designed to be used simultaneously in print and online platforms and supports over 200 world languages. Archivo has been upgraded to a variable font in 2021. The weight and width axes allow a wide variety of styles, from Thin to Black and from ExtraCondensed to Expanded. Archivo is designed by Héctor Gatti and Omnibus-Type Team.

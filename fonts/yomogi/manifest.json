  "description": "Yomogi is extra thin hand writing font that is easy to read and makes a strong impression. It includes Google Latin Plus, hiragana, katakana, JIS level 1 and 2 kanji glyphs. The design of the letters combined cuteness and readability, and it is made into a monospaced font that could also be used in the vertical writing style.

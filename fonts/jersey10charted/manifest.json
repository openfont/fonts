  "description": "The Soft Type Collection is designed for knitters to chart out their typographic projects. Jersey is a sporty, versitile sans-serif typeface, knittable at various sizes. Each typeface has a “Regular” and “Charted” version, and some include multiple scales so you can fit type on your knits, no matter the project's size. Check out the non-charted version Jersey 10 . In this collection, the number following the typeface's name indicates the height of the capital letters for that typeface. To contribute, please see github.com/scfried/soft-type-jersey .",

  "description": "\"Cactus Classical Serif\" is an open source font suitable for Traditional Chinese environments. This font uses inherited glyphs, largely adhering to the Inherited Glyphs standard maintained by the I.Font Project , combined with other commonly seen inherited glyphs, to produce a Chinese typeface with glyphs in the traditional style. This font is produced by Tian Haidong. Moonlit Owen has assisted in the font production and is also a maintainer. The CJK characters are based on glyphs prepared by Henry Chan on GlyphWiki, with modifications and characters supplemented by Tian Haidong. The Latin characters, Kana characters, and other symbols are based on glyphs from the Genyo Font developed by But Ko based on Source Han Serif .

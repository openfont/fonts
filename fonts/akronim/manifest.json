  "description": "Akronim is a brand-new, original, brush like, stylish font with a Western and Central European (e.g. Polish, Croatian, Czech, Magyar etc.) Latin character set. Handmade in Poland, Europe, by Grzegorz Klimczewski . An acronym (in Polish, \"akronim\") is an abbreviation that forms a word. So this story is cut short. To understand it, imagine a nice girl with beautifully plaited slavic hair, strolling among the fields of wheat. If you imagine this, you will find a good use for this tasteful, brand-new typeface.",

  "description": "Intended for continuous reading on the web (longer articles in online news, magazines, blogs), Rasa supports over 92 languages in Latin and 2 in Gujarati script (Gujarati and Kachchi). The fonts supports a wide array of basic and compound syllables used in Gujarati. A Latin-only version is available as Yrsa . In terms of glyphs included Rasa is a superset of Yrsa and includes the complete Latin, but in Rasa the Latin may be adjusted to support the primary Gujarati font. It is a deliberate experiment in remixing existing typefaces: The Latin part began with Eben Sorkin's Merriweather . The Gujarati began with David Březina’s Skolar Gujarati .

  "description": "Originally inspired by the black face Impact, it soon evolved to include numerous weights from the Black flavor of its progenitor to a super Thin weight. The extreme weights (Thin and Black) are designed for display situations while the remaining weights may be used for more traditional textual design applications. Alumni is available in roman and italic versions. It comes with Latin character sets including Western, Central, and Vietnamese language support. To contribute, see github.com/googlefonts/alumni .",

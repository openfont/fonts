  "description": "Red Hat is a family of typefaces produced in 2 optical sizes and this monospace style, each with a range of weights and with italics. The fonts were originally commissioned by Paula Scher at Pentagram, and designed by Jeremy Mickel at MCKL for a new Red Hat brand identity. The Red Hat typefaces are a fresh take on the geometric sans genre, taking inspiration from a range of American sans serifs including Tempo and Highway Gothic. The Display styles are low contrast and spaced tightly, with a large x-height and open counters. The Text styles have a slightly smaller x-height and narrower width for better legibility, are spaced more generously, and have thinned joins for better performance at small sizes. The two families can be used together seamlessly at a range of sizes. The November 2024 update addresses a frequently reported weight issue. The Medium and SemiBold weights now have slightly different weight compared to the previous version, ensuring better weight distribution within the design space and improved fluidity in the variable font.

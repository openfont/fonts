  "description": "This calligraphic typeface comes with a Roman Version and a more flourished stylistic set. The main style has less ornate uppercase forms and the second has more flourished upper- and lowercase characters for a beautiful hand-lettered feel. Perfect for tubes, tags, invitations and other projects that need a personal touch. It comes with Latin Character sets including Western, Central, and Vietnamese language support.

  "description": "Fascinate and Fascinate Inline are nods to Art Deco yesteryear and typefaces like Broadway, yet they have an exaggerated x-height and softness that give them a friendly yet sophisticated vibe. Even with their high contrast weighting, the Fascinate family is cleanly legible at small sizes, although the Inline version is better visible at larger display sizes.",

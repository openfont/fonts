  "description": "Advent Pro is a modern font designed for web and print. Advent Pro utilizes some of the universal characteristics of the sans-serif genre with modern characteristics to give an edge to your typography. The family was upgraded to a variable font with additional Italic styles in December 2022. The spacing and kerning was improved, which could lead to a slightly different text line length than the previous version. To contribute, see github.com/googlefonts/Advent .",

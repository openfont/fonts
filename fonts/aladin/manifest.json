  "description": "Aladin is a calligraphic vintage face with a middle eastern touch, designed by Angel Koziupa and produced by Alejandro Paul. Casual, airy counters and friendly terminals give it an advantage as a packaging font for exotic coffees and teas. It also serves quite well on posters and book jackets where relaying the famous sense of Eastern hospitality and playfulness is a must.",

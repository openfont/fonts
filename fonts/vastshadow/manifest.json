  "description": "Foundry: Sorkin Type Co Vast is a Victorian slab serif advertising type. Vast has a feeling of sturdy solidity combined with just a little bit of refinement. Because Vast Shadow has a thin shadow that won't display well at small sizes we recommend that you use it from 32px and larger. Source files are available from Google Code . To contribute to the project contact Eben Sorkin .",

  "description": "Bowlby One has been designed for use as a utilitarian, all caps display font. A version with lowercase characters is also available. Its forms are a fusion of a handfull of designs scanned from old, early Twentieth Century type specimens. Bowlby One is perfect for big bold headlines and display uses that need a slightly roughened look. Bowlby is a web font, designed to be used freely across the internet by web browsers on desktop computers, laptops, cloud systems and mobile devices.",

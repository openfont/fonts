  "description": "Heebo is a Hebrew and Latin typeface family, which extends Christian Roberton's Roboto Latin to Hebrew. The Hebrew was drawn by Oded Ezer and the font files were mastered by Meir Sadan. Since the Hebrew design of this family is primary, the vertical metrics are different to the original Roboto family. This family is auto-hinted, whereas Roboto is hand-hinted, so the rendering quality of Roboto may be better on older Windows machines. In May 2020, the family has been updated to a variable font family. The November 2023 update fixed some Hebrew bugs and improve the langage support. The Heebo project is led by Oded Ezer, a type designer based in Tel Aviv, Israel. To contribute, see github.com/OdedEzer/heebo",

  "description": "Grechen Fuemen is a playful font with an unorthodox use of thick and thin weights. Don't take this font too seriously because there's not a serious stroke in the font. It comes with Latin Character sets including Western, Central, and Vietnamese language support. To contribute, see github.com/googlefonts/grechen-fuemen .",

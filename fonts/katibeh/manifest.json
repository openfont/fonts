  "description": "Katibeh is a headline font based on the Naskh script, infused with some qualities of the Thuluth script. The small serif-like outstrokes make Katibeh remind us of archaic designs, but other aspects of the design are very contemporary touches. The result is something between tradition and today. Katibeh has ligatures that Arabic and Persian readers are familiar with, to make it comfortable for reading longer texts. Unlike many other Arabic fonts, Katibeh includes a Latin typeface designed for harmony with the Arabic to make it useful for multilingual texts. The Latin is scaled to work best with the Arabic component. The Katibeh project is led by KB Studio, a design studio in Los Angeles. To contribute, see github.com/Tarobish/Katibeh",

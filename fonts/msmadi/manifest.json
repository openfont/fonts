  "description": "Ms Madi is a monoline hand written script. It's clean connections and quite legible hand written cursive style works great in situations that require a relatively sophisticated casual look. As with any cursive script, it is never a good idea to use this font in all capital letters. It comes with Latin Character sets including Western, Central, and Vietnamese language support.

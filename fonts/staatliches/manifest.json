  "description": "Staatliches is a clean cut display face with charmingly unconventional proportions. The alphabet was designed in response to Herbert Bayer’s title lettering on the cover of the first Bauhaus exhibition catalogue , which was published in 1923. It features full sets of capitals, numbers, punctuation, and symbols, in addition to alternate widths, discretionary ligatures, and common Latin accents.",

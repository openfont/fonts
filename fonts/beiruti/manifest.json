  "description": "Beiruti is a distinctive modern Arabic typeface, available as a variable font with a weight axis with unlimited styles from Thin to Black. The design was created by Boutros to offer a modern geometric style while still respecting the rules of Arabic calligraphy. The fluid geometry makes it the perfect choice to use in both print and web applications, and alongside its harmonized and built-in Latin typeface companion. The Arabic is designed by Arlette Boutros, while the Latin is designed by Volker Schnebel. To contribute, please see github.com/googlefonts/beiruti .",

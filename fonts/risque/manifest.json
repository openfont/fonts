  "description": "Risque finds its inspiration from the title screen of the 1962 Looney Toons cartoon called \"Martian through Georgia\". Originally an all Capitals reference, it has been created with a lowercase as lively as the irregular latin-esque Capitals. A frolicking fun typeface for retro and all-around offbeat occasions. To contribute to the project contact Brian J. Bonislawsky .",

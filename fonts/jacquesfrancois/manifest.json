  "description": "Jacques Francois revives the c. 1760 Enschedé no. 811 type specimen by Jacques François Rosart (1714-1774), made for Enschedé Printing House. The concept was to create a contemporary webfont with an even typographic color while preserving the essential historic peculiarities and expanding the character set. Compared to the historic specimen the x-height is generously increased and contrast lowered. Jacques Francois is designed for medium to small sizes. For this purpose its features were altered: contrast was lowered and x-height significantly increased. Designed by Manvel Shmavonyan, Alexei Vanyashin. Jacques Francois includes old style figures. There is also Jacques Francois Shadow , an incised variant of the Jacques Francois font. To contribute to the project contact Alexei Vanyashin .",

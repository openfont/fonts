  "description": "'Merienda' is a Spanish term for \"afternoon snack\", and this pleasant time of the day was worth its own typography. Merienda has soft shapes, is slightly condensed, and has a rhythm which is an invitation to read short pieces of text. It is ideal for headlines which call for height, as its strokes resemble those of a brush and deliver freshness and a dynamic touch in the development of words. Merienda One is the initial publication of this typeface family in a single boldstyle. In september 2022, the font is updated as a variable and now offers 7 styles, ranging from light to black. The glyphset has also been extended, offering a larger number of supported languages. To contribute, see github.com/etunni/merienda .",

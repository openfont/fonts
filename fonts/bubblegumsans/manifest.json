  "description": "Bubblegum Sans is upbeat, flavor-loaded, brushalicious letters for the sunny side of the street. It bounces with joy and tells a great story. Designed by Angel Koziupa and produced by Ale Paul, this typeface is a loud 21st century shoutout to the kind of the 1930s lettering that sold everything to everyone through every medium.

  "description": "Hind Guntur is a family of five Telugu fonts, which are part of the Indian Type Foundry’s larger Open Source Hind Multi-Script project. In addition to Telugu, the Hind Guntur fonts also include Latin-script characters. Developed explicitly for use in User Interface design, Hind Guntur’s letterforms have a humanist-style construction, paired with seemingly monolinear strokes. Most strokes have flat endings: they either terminate with a horizontal or a vertical shear, rather than on a diagonal. This helps create clear-cut counter forms between the characters. Additionally, Hind Guntur’s letterforms feature open apertures and counterforms. The entire family feels very legible when used to set text. Hind Guntur is a solid alternate when choosing typefaces for UI design, and a wise selection for electronic display embedding. Hind Guntur is named after Guntur, a city where Telugu is used. The Hind Guntur project is led by Indian Type Foundry, a type design foundry based in Ahmedabad, India. To contribute, see github.com/itfoundry/hind-guntur",

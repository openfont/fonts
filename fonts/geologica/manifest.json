  "description": "Geologica is grounded in the humanist genre, but leans assertively into geometric, constructed letterforms to find its stability. The wide stance, generous spacing, large apertures and even colour makes Geologica a serious text typeface. The stylistic “Sharpness” axis adds a rational interpretation of calligraphic pen strokes - a modernist echo of the roots of writing. Variable axes: Cursive (CRSV) Sharpness (SHRP) Weight (wght) Slant (slnt) To contribute, please see https://github.com/googlefonts/geologica .",

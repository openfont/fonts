  "description": "Cabin is a humanist sans inspired by Edward Johnston&apos;s and Eric Gill&apos;s typefaces, with a touch of modernism. Cabin incorporates modern proportions, optical adjustments, and some elements of the geometric sans. It remains true to its roots, but has its own personality. The Cabin font family comes in two variable fonts, roman and true italic, with a Weight range from Regular to Bold, and a Width range from normal to Condensed. The stroke contrast is almost monolinear, although top and bottom curves are slightly thinned. Counters of the b, g, p and q are rounded, and all are optically adjusted. Cabin has wide language support, including full Latin coverage of Vietnamese, additional to all Western, Central, and South/Eastern European languages. To contribute, see github.com/impallari/Cabin",

  "description": "Unbounded is possibly the first open source, freely available and on-chain funded font in the world, thanks to the Polkadot treasury. Unbounded by both name and nature, it is available in eight display weights ranging from Light to Black as a variable font. The typeface supports both Latin and Cyrillic scripts with over 1300 individual glyphs, including a collection of symbols and a unique figure building system. In addition the sizeable glyph set accommodates for hundreds of languages worldwide. Unbounded is the product of a joint collaboration between Studio Koto , NaN, Parity Technologies and Web3 Foundation for Polkadot Network .

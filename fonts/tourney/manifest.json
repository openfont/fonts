  "description": "Tourney is a collaboration of tech and sport. At least, that is where the inspiration came from. Tourney would feel at home on a space ship or in a stadium. The lightest weight of Tourney (100) is almost an outline and that \"stroke\" thickens as the weights increase. 900 is completely solid. To contribute, see github.com/Etcetera-Type-Co/Tourney .",

  "description": "Holtwood is a bold display font developed for use with modern web browsers. It has a lot of the look of some traditional woodblock poster typefaces of the Nineteenth Century but updated for the Twenty First. Holtwood was envisioned to be used in big and bold text sizes, but it still works well when running as smaller headlines too. To contribute, see github.com/googlefonts/HoltwoodFont .",

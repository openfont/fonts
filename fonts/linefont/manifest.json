  "description": "Linefont is a variable font with Weight and Width axes for rendering small to medium-scale line charts. Linefont values span from 0 to 100, assigned to different characters: 0-9 chars are for simplified manual input with step 10 (bar height = number). a-z/A-Z for manual input with step 2, softened at edges a and Z (bar height = number of letter). U+0100-017F for 0..127 values with step 1. The axis range values are compatible with Wavefont by the same author, so the families can be used together with visual coherency.

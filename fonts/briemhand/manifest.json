  "description": "Briem Hand is elegant while also being quite accessible and very legible. It is direct and sincere without being excessively sentimental. It provides a range of weights, and comes with and without guides and joins. Briem Hand is an extended version of Gunnlaugur's 'Briem Script' which was designed in 1992. The Briem Hand is a modern adaptation of sixteenth-century chancery cursive. Briem Hand includes Latin Vietnamese, all Western, Central, and South-Eastern European languages, Sami, South American and nearly all African language support, as well as several OpenType features (old-style and tabular figures, superscript and subscript numerals, fractions, stylistic alternates).

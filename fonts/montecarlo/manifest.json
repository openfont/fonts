  "description": "MonteCarlo is a beautiful formal script— both contemporary and traditional. This connecting script’s italic is slight, making it an extremely legible design. Its additional flourishing options offer truly diverse possibilities for customization of display. MonteCarlo is perfect for those situations that require an ornate look, and a readable message, without compromising beautiful design. It comes with Latin Character sets including Western, Central, and Vietnamese language support. To contribute, see github.com/googlefonts/monte-carlo .",

  "description": "Instrument Sans is a font designed for the Instrument brand. It's a variable sans-serif which balances an abundance of precision with subtle notes of playfulness. Inspiration was drawn from our enduring interest in neo-grotesques. In a way, this family of weights, widths, and italics represent an orchestration of all of our favorite qualities in a sans-serif while featuring contemporary characteristics that make this typeface distinctly our own. Featuring 12 unique stylistic sets, commonly-used characters can be replaced with alternate glyphs in a variety of combinations to tailor the appearance and legibility of messaging. This flexibility allows for a wide range of expressive styles, making it easy to mold it to perfectly suit whatever style of expression is needed.

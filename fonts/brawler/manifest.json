  "description": "Brawler is a compact typeface with sharp features and a sturdy character, designed for comfortable reading in small sizes. It was initially planned as a typeface for newspapers and tabloids. Thus, the design concept was shaped by the demands of low quality printing media and the aesthetic preferences of periodical publications. To contribute, see github.com/cyrealtype/Brawler .",

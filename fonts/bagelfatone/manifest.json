  "description": "Bagel Fat is a very heavy/fat font with rounded details. By these rounded corners, the overall mood is cute and lovely which is inspired by bread, pastries and sweets. Also a large contrast at where the horizontal and the vertical stroke come across makes it unique, not just cute. To contribute, please visit github.com/JAMO-TYPEFACE/BagelFat .",

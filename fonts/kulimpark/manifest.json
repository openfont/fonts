  "description": "Kulim Park is a sans serif typeface, with high x-height, open counter 'a', minimal degrees of contrast in stem width, inviting bowls and a design language aimed at encapsulating openness. This typeface is the result of an exploration of how a local park redevelopment can inform a typographic design. The Kulim Park project is led by Dale Sattler, a type designer based in New Zealand. To contribute, see github.com/noponies/Kulim-Park",

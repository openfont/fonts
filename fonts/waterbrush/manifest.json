  "description": "It's cool and refreshing. Water Brush is a contemporary script style. The dry brush texture is indicative of a camel hair brush filled with color on a watercolor textured paper. The characters are loose and expressive— perfect for casual and sophisticated situations. It comes with Latin Character sets including Western, Central, and Vietnamese language support.

  "description": "Inspired by the hand painted signs in supermarkets, and the roman structures of the classical alphabets. Poetsen is a display font, but it's not just intended to be used on big 'straight to the eye' titles. Since it has a large x-height, it can be used on short paragraphs in relatively small bodies of text too.",

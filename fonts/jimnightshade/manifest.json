  "description": "Certain calligraphic pen styles have always had a mysterious and almost dark vibe to them from my viewpoint. Jim Nightshade is one of those styles. Named after a character from the story, \"Something Wicked This Way Comes\", Jim Nightshade is a flat nib calligraphic typestyle with charisma and a dark flair. Letterforms follow that of a traditional italic hand but with more angular strokes to accentuate the look.",

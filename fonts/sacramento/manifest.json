  "description": "The Sacramento typeface is a monoline, semi-connected script inspired by hand-lettering artist brochure work of the 1950's and 1960's. It stands on a thin line between formal and casual lettering styles, yet it has a commanding presence for headlines and titles. To contribute to the project contact Brian J. Bonislawsky .",

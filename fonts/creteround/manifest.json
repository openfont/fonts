  "description": "Crete Round is a warm slab serif providing a hint of softness to texts. It started as a tailored version of the original Crete fonts , created specially to serve as corporate typeface for the type design competition Letter2 . Crete Round is more independent from the original with modified terminals and serifs to create two new fonts that deliver a more contemporary and functional appearance. The tall x-height, low contrast and sturdy slabs prove to be surprisingly efficient for web use.",

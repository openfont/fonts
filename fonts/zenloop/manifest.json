  "description": "Zen Loop Family is one of three Latin fonts designed by Yoshimichi Ohira, as part of Zen Fonts collection. Japanese kana characters contain many loops. Zen Loop and Zen Loop Italic incorporates this visual aspect into a Latin font. The font looks as though it was shaped out of a thin wire, and almost depicts the movements of a living organism.

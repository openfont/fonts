  "description": "Gloock is a contemporary high-contrast serif typeface intended for display use. It draws inspiration from newspaper's headlines but with a contemporary approach. Its main focus is the smooth relationship between the thin and thick strokes. It's a perfect typeface for headlines and has a great performance anywhere in big sizes.

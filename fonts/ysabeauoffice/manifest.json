  "description": "Ysabeau combines the familiar timeless letterforms of the Garamond legacy with the unencumbered crispness of a clean low-contrast sans serif. Unlike other humanist sans, Ysabeau retains the confident wide stride and unapologetic extenders of the world's favorite book face for unmitigated reading comfort. Try it on your e-reader and never look back! Pair it with EB Garamond or Cormorant for a perfect match, or blow it up to page-filling sizes and revel in its elegance. Ysabeau offers extensive Latin, Greek and Cyrillic. To contribute, see github.com/CatharsisFonts/Ysabeau .",

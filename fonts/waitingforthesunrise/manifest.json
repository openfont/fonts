  "description": "Waiting for the Sunrise is based on the handwriting of a high school student. The title comes from the song Lift Me Up by The Afters . Although this font was created during a time of darkness in my life, it is a cheery, perky font. It is a reminder to me of the joy that comes after mourning.",

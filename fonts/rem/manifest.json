  "description": "The REM font family is a sans serif font ready for corporate and display uses. It features a heavy low contrast combined with outstrokes that get slightly thinner, which is the opposite of the conventional approach. All together gives it a contemporary feeling suitable for modern branding. With more than 960 glyphs the font is ready for complex type setting with four sets of figures, Small Caps and some alternate glyphs. The name REM is an acronym for \"Rapid Eye Movement,\" which refers to a stage of sleep characterized by quick, random eye movements. I dreamt of it and began drawing it from my dream.

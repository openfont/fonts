  "description": "Purple Purse draws its inspiration from a vintage Ivory Soap ad from the 1950's. Somewhat of a cross between Bodoni and Pixie, this font finds that it never truly takes itself seriously. The fun little bounce of the typeface gives it a perky personality. To contribute to the project contact Brian J. Bonislawsky .",

  "description": "The Soft Type Collection is designed for knitters to chart out their typographic projects. Yarndings is an ornamental typeface inspired by a mix of typographic ornamentation, traditional Fair Isle & Nordic knitting patterns, and dingbat fonts from the 1990's. Each typeface has a “Regular” and “Charted” version, and some include multiple scales so you can fit type on your knits, no matter the project's size. Check out the charted version Yarndings 20 Charted . In this collection, the number following the typeface's name indicates the height of the capital letters for that typeface.

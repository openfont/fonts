  "description": "Cairo is a contemporary multilingual typeface family. Mohamed Gaber extended the Latin typeface family Titillum Web to support the Arabic script, with a design that is based on the Kufi calligraphic style. Now available as a variable font. Cairo balances classic and contemporary tastes with wide open counters and short ascenders and descenders that minimize length while maintaining easy readability. The lighter weights can be used for body text while the heavier weights are perfect for headlines and display typography. The Arabic component has a wide glyph set that supports the Arabic, Farsi and Urdu languages. The Cairo project is led by Mohamed Gaber , a type designer based in Cairo, Egypt.

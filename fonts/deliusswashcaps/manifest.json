  "description": "Delius Swash Caps is part of a high quality comic book lettering typeface super-family. It has special uppercase letters for special uses, such as in titles and logos. It has companion families, Delius and Delius Unicase. A round marker was used to define Delius's stroke: the line gets thicker at both ends to define the beginning and end of the stroke, as a marker line would do, and the ductus imitates the movements of handwriting.",

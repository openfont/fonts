  "description": "This font is based on the handwriting of a perky, cheerful young preschool teacher. From her love of her Cedarville University alma mater to her passion for her students, she is a delightful, dependable person. I think her handwriting contains that same blend of fun appeal with restrained discipline alongside it. Many handwritten script fonts have large flourishes, but this is a more simple script, similar to authentic daily handwriting.",

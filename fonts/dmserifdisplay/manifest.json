  "description": "DM Serif Display is a high-contrast transitional face. With delicate serifs and fine detailing, the design has been shaped for use in super-sized poster settings. It is accompanied by DM Serif Text , for use in smaller point ranges. DM Serif Display supports a Latin Extended glyph set, enabling typesetting for English and other Western European languages. It was designed by Colophon Foundry (UK), that started from the Latin portion of Adobe Source Serif 4 , by Frank Grießhammer et al. To contribute, see github.com/googlefonts/dm-fonts",

  "description": "Sarala is a Devanagari typeface family designed by Andrés Torresi and Carolina Giovagnoli for Huerta Tipográfica. It is based on the original Latin typeface Telex , a sans serif typeface for text. It is a humanist sans serif design, conceived to be a web font with nice legibility at normal text sizes. Originally based on grid fitting shapes it became a multi-purpose typeface with low contrast, open counter forms, wide proportions and a touch of freshness. Thanks to José Nicolás Silva, Vaishnavi Murthy and Erin McLaughlin for their feedback. The Sarala project is led by Andrés Torresi, a type designer based in Argentina.

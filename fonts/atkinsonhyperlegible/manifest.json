  "description": "Atkinson Hyperlegible, named after the founder of the Braille Institute, has been developed specifically to increase legibility for readers with low vision, and to improve comprehension. Having a traditional grotesque sans-serif at its core, it departs from tradition to incorporate unambiguous, distinctive elements—and at times, unexpected forms—always with the goal of increasing character recognition and ultimately improve reading. To contribute, see github.com/googlefonts/atkinson-hyperlegible . To learn more, read From Rebranding to Readability with Atkinson Hyperlegible .",

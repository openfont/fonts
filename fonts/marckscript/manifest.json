  "description": "Marck Script is based on freehand lettering with felt-tip pen by Marck Fogel. The main advantage over other similar fonts is the lack of connections between characters, that allows wide variety of spacing between letters. It can be used for logotypes, headlines and for short pieces of text, wherever you want to create an informal, confident relationship - it is readable, comfortable and welcoming.",

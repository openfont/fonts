  "description": "Merriweather was designed to be a text face that is pleasant to read on screens. It features a very large x height, slightly condensed letterforms, a mild diagonal stress, sturdy serifs and open forms. There is also Merriweather Sans , a sans-serif version which closely harmonizes with the weights and styles of this serif family. The Merriweather project is led by Sorkin Type, a type design foundry based in Western Massachaussets, USA. To contribute, see github.com/SorkinType/Merriweather",

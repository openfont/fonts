  "description": "Shippori Antique follows long-established standards for dialogue in manga and was created to provide people who draw manga in Japan a beautiful antique font for free. The Kana follow an antique, Ming Dynasty style design based on Shippori Mincho with thick lines. The Latin was designed in an old sans-serif style. Finally, the Kanji was created by modifying the SIL licensed Genseki Gothic. Shippori Antique is the standard version of the font. Shippori Antique B1 ( https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Shippori+Antique+B1 ) has rounded corners and ink pooling. To contribute to the project, visit github.com/fontdasu/ShipporiAntique",

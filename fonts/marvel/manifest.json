  "description": "Marvel is a contemporary and multipurpose sans serif typeface family. It can be used in headlines as well as text settings in websites, books and magazines. It was designed to look sharp, modern and even technical while keeping a unique personality. Typography has always been very important in my graphic design work, and some time ago I started working on experimental type, designing typefaces for use in my own projects so that I could give more personality to them.",

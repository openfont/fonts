  "description": "Ingrid Darling is a cute script font originally created for greeting cards. It is based on a cursive hand writing style that has a playful, whimsical appeal. It would be best served as a display font and should be used sparingly rather than in larger bodies of type. It comes with Latin Character sets including Western, Central, and Vietnamese language support. To contribute, see github.com/googlefonts/ingrid-darling .",

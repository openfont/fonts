  "description": "Yatra One is a Devanagari and Latin libre font inspired by the hand-painted signage of the Mumbai local railway. This heavy weight high-contrast display face preserves the idiosyncratic character of brush-painted signage by featuring angular cuts and open knots. Notably, the Latin adopts a Devanagari brush angle. A Mumbai native, Yatra offers basic Marathi alternates. The Yatra One project is led by Catherine Leigh Schmidt, a type designer based in the USA.

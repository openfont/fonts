  "description": "Changa One is intended for titles, with its short ascenders and descenders and a set of lowercase letters inscribed within a square. The uppercases case gains slightly more in height and develops its morphology in a single height in order to make it possible to create text composition with minimum line spacing. Its counter-shapes are rectangular, featuring small curvatures in opposite vertexes which accompany and break the shapes, thus evoking a modern style. Changa is also available, a continuation of the development of this typeface as a regular weight sister family intended for text usage. To contribute to the project contact Eduardo Tunni .",

  "description": "Nunito is a well balanced sans serif typeface superfamily, with 2 versions: The project began with Nunito , created by Vernon Adams as a rounded terminal sans serif for display typography. Jacques Le Bailly extended it to a full set of weights, and an accompanying regular non-rounded terminal version, Nunito Sans. In February 2023, Nunito Sans has been upgraded to a variable font with four axes: ascenders high, optical size, width and weight. Cyrillic has been added and the language support expanded.

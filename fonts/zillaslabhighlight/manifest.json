  "description": "Zilla Slab is Mozilla's core typeface, used for the Mozilla wordmark, headlines and throughout their designs. A contemporary slab serif, based on Typotheque's Tesla, it is constructed with smooth curves and true italics, which gives text an unexpectedly sophisticated industrial look and a friendly approachability in all weights. This is the Highlight sister family. Designed by Typotheque , this project is led by Mozilla. To contribute, see github.com/mozilla/zilla-slab",

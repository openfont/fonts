  "description": "Pavanam is a Tamil and Latin typeface designed with a focus on greater legibility in smaller sizes for both screen and print media. The Latin design is derived from Vernon Adam's Pontano Sans ; it has been slightly modified to match with the Tamil typefaces's proportions and vertical metrics. The word Pavanam means wind in Tamil. The Pavanam project is led by Tharique Azeez, a type designer based in Sri Lanka. To contribute, see github.com/enathu/pavanam",

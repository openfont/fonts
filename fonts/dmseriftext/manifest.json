  "description": "DM Serif Text is a lower-contrast counterpart to the high-contrast DM Serif Display . While the serifs remain delicate, the DM Serif Text family is a more robust variant of the Display sibling, intended for smaller sub-headings and text sizes. DM Serif Text supports a Latin Extended glyph set, enabling typesetting for English and other Western European languages. It was designed by Colophon Foundry (UK), that started from the Latin portion of Adobe Source Serif 4 , by Frank Grießhammer et al. To contribute, see github.com/googlefonts/dm-fonts",

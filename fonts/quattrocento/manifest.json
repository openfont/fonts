  "description": "Classic, elegant, sober and strong, the Quattrocento typeface has wide and open letterforms. The generous x-height makes it very legible for body text at small sizes, while the tiny details can only be seen at larger sizes mean it is also a great choice for display typography. Some of their distinctive characteristics are: Low Contrast. The thins are just a tad thiner than the thicks, almost monotone. Cupped, tapered stems that flows naturally into the serifs. Distinctive K, R and & tail. Cupped B, D, E, F, P, Q, R and T. The Q is a humble expression of admiration and gratitude for Doyald Young. Alternate M, Two W alternates. Narrow L, T for better fit. Almost flat top serif on the lowercases. Shoulders of the m and n rise above the serif. Serif-less bottom j and y. It's the perfect sans-serif companion for Quattrocento Sans .",

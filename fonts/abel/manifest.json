  "description": "Abel is a modern interpretation of the condensed flat-sided sans serif. Originally used for newspaper headlines and posters, this style can also be used for text on the web. Its angled terminals and spiked stems give it enough style to be unique at display sizes, while its mono-weight still works well at smaller text sizes. Documentation can be found at www.madtype.com and to contribute to the project contact Matthew Desmond at mattdesmond@gmail.com",

  "description": "Patrick Hand is a font based on the designer's own handwriting. It is developed to bring an impressive and useful handwriting effect to your texts. There is a Small Caps sister family. It has all the basic latin characters as well as most of the latin extended ones. It also includes some fancy glyphs like heavy quotation marks and the floral heart! Ligatures, small caps and old style numbers are available as OpenType features in the downloaded version of this font. Updated January 2013 with support for more European languages and Vietnamese, and in February with a Small Caps sister family.",

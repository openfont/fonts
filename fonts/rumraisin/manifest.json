  "description": "Rum Raisin draws inspiration from a vintage Kelloggs Raisin Bran cereal box. Taken from a formerly unicase design, this has been developed as a caps/lowercase character set. The original unicase a is in the Delta character slot, as an alternate to a more suitable A. To contribute to the project contact Brian J. Bonislawsky .",

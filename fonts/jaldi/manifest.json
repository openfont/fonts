  "description": "Jaldi is the Hindi word for soon, and the typeface family is a contemporary sans-serif Devanagari with subtle rounded corners. Designed by Nicolas Silva and Pablo Cosgaya, Jaldi is developed to match with the Latin design of the Asap family , named after the acronym \"As Soon As Possible.\" This family is specially developed for screen reading and use as a webfont, and like Asap is has a special twist: Jaldi offers a standardised character width on all styles, which means that lines of text always remain the same length. This useful feature allows users to change type styles on-the-go without reflowing text bodies. Asap is based on Ancha, designed by Pablo Cosgaya and Hector Gatti in collaboration with Andres Torresi. This project is led by Omnibus Type, a type foundry based in Argentina.

  "description": "Alike is a text typeface with expressive and tense letterforms. Its design features are said to have Czech influence, but are softened for a friendlier feel. The proportions are regular and the contrast is low for a pleasant reading experience. Alike Angular is a complementary titling style. Designed by Sveta Sebyakina in 2009, and in collaboration with Alexei Vanyashin it was first released in 2011 by Cyreal. To contribute to the project, visit github.com/cyrealtype/Alike",

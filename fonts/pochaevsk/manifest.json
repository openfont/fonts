  "description": "Pochaevsk is a contemporary Church Slavonic font that reproduces the typeface used in editions published by the Holy Dormition Pochaiv Lavra in the late 19th century and, subsequently, in editions published in the 20th century by Holy Trinity Monastery in Jordanville, New York. Due to its small vertical metrics, this font is convenient for use in bilingual editions featuring Church Slavonic text and text in another languages.

Grab a drink, a hammock under a swaying palm tree and let your hair down as your fingers gently caress the keyboard just like seaweed! Enjoy Seaweed Script when a rustic tropical beachside script is called for and watch out for squid! Designed by Dave 'Squid' Cohen of Neapolitan, a Font Diner brand.",

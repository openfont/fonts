  "description": "Lora is a well-balanced contemporary serif with roots in calligraphy. It is a text typeface with moderate contrast well suited for body text. A paragraph set in Lora will make a memorable appearance because of its brushed curves in contrast with driving serifs. The overall typographic voice of Lora perfectly conveys the mood of a modern-day story, or an art essay. Technically Lora is optimised for screen appearance, and works equally well in print. In March 2019, the family has been updated to a variable font family. To contribute, see github.com/cyrealtype/Lora-Cyrillic .",

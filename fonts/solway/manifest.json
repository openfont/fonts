It is a contemporary family defined by the soft corners, ball terminals, rounded slabs that give it a welcoming and friendly appeal. Its monoline structure and minimal stroke contrast aspire to cohesion and stability. Available in five weights, it is suitable for a variety of projects. It could find perfect expression within lifestyle brands or nature, travel and foodie blogs. To contribute, see github.com/mashavp/Solway .",

  "description": "Truculenta is an irregular sans serif typeface based on mid-century lettering works, yet with a little twist. This quirky grotesque is a variable font with three axes (weight, width and optical size), allowing a wide range of text sizes without losing readability. This vibrant typeface is highly suitable for packaging, branding, book covers, illustrated editions, and film titles. Truculenta was designed by Ivan Castro, Eva Sanz and Omnibus-Type Team. To contribute, see github.com/Omnibus-Type/Truculenta .",

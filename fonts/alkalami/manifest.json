  "description": "Alkalami is the local word for the Arabic \"qalam\", a type of sharpened stick used for writing on wooden boards in the Kano region of Nigeria and in Niger, and what gives the style its distinct appearance. The baseline stroke is very thick and solid. The ascenders and other vertical strokes including the teeth are very narrow when compared to the baseline. A generous line height is necessary to allow for deep swashes and descenders, and the overall look of the page is a very black, solid rectangle. Diacritics are much smaller in scale, with very little distance from the main letters. Learn more at github.com/silnrsi/font-alkalami . To contribute, see github.com/silnrsi/font-alkalami .",

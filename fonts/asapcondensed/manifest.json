  "description": "Asap Condensed is the condensed version of the Asap family . Its a contemporary sans-serif family with subtle rounded corners. Designed by Pablo Cosgaya and Nicolás Silva, Asap (\"as soon as possible\") has 8 styles: Regular, Medium, Semibold, Bold and its italics. This family, specially developed for screen and desktop use, offers a standarised character width on all styles, which means lines of text remain the same length. This useful feature allows users to change type styles on-the-go without reflowing a text body. Asap is based on Ancha (designed by Pablo Cosgaya and Hector Gatti), and has been developed with the collaboration of Andr&eacute;s Torresi.

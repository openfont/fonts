  "description": "Aleo is a contemporary typeface designed by Alessio Laiso as the slab serif companion to the Lato font by Łukasz Dziedzic. Aleo has semi-rounded details and a sleek structure, giving it a strong personality while still keeping readability high. The June 2023 update expanded the family from 6 style to 18 and became variable. It offers also a better language support (Pan African and Vietnamese added), and the design and spacing have been improved. To contribute, see github.com/AlessioLaiso/aleo .",

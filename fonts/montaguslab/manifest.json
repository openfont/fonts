  "description": "Montagu Slab is a slab-serif display typeface designed by Florian Karsten. The typeface draws inspiration from 19th-century classic designs and it is available as a variable font with weight and optical size axes. The optical size axis, which controls x-height, spacing, contrast and aperture, provides a wide range of variation – from low contrast and higher x-height version suitable for long texts, to a tight and high contrast display variant with prominent upturned tails. To contribute, see github.com/floriankarsten/montagu-slab .",

  "description": "Lemonada is a modern Arabic and Latin typeface family designed by Mohamed Gaber and Eduardo Tunni. It started with the Latin design Lemon , which Eduardo Tunni expanded to four weights. The Arabic was designed by Mohamed Gaber. The Arabic design is contemporary, starting with Naskh and introducing influences of Diwani. It has wide and open counters that improve readability at smaller text sizes, while its more subtle details make it a great display face at larger sizes. Lemonada is currently available as a variable font with a weight axis, four static fonts (Light, Regular, SemiBold, Bold), and a wide character set that supports the Arabic, Farsi, and Urdu languages. The Lemonada project is led by Mohamed Gaber, a type designer based in Cairo, Egypt. To contribute, see github.com/Gue3bara/Lemonada",

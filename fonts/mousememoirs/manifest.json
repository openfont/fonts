  "description": "Mouse Memoirs finds its inspiration in the vintage Mickey Mouse, Beagle Boys, and Uncle Scrooge comic books put out by Walt Disney in the 1950's and 60's. This font comes alive with a truly animated look. Perfect for light-hearted designs, children's books, and the like… it is an all-around fun typeface. To contribute to the project contact Brian J. Bonislawsky .",

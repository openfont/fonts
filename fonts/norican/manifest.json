  "description": "Norican is a script-like display font designed to be used freely across the internet by web browsers on desktop computers, laptops and mobile devices. Norican's design is based on the merging of a number of old script fonts, most notably Stephenson Blake's 'Glenmoy' from the 1920s. The August 2023 update features a bigger glyphset and some minor aesthetic modifications. To contribute, see github.com/googlefonts/NoricanFont .",

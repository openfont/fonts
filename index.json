      "description": "Abhaya Libre is the unicode compliant, complete libre version of the most widely used Sinhala typeface ‘FM Abhaya’ and includes Sinhala and Latin support. Designed in 1996, ‘FM Abhaya’ is an interpretation of the Sinhala letterpress typefaces from 1960s. The name ‘Abhaya’ is derived from the King Abhaya (474 BCE to 454 BCE) who reigned Sri Lanka from the ancient kingdom of Upatissa Nuwara. ‘Abhaya Libre’ was completely redrawn from scratch based on FM Abhaya to comply with modern day usages in terms of web, tab and smaller sizes for smartphones. Available in 5 weights, Abhaya Libre enables designers to build sophisticated typographic layouts by using lighter weights for body text and heavier weights for headlines and subheadings. Each of these weights contains 925 glyphs that enables clean and precise rendering for Sinhala, Pali and Sanskrit texts. Compact ‘Da’ forms can be enabled by using stylistic sets. The Latin characters, that match the aesthetics of ‘Abhaya Libre Sinhala’, which was inspired by the style of the original Sinhala with an eminent contrast between distinctive strokes that go from thick to thin and was further modified to co-exist with the visual logics of Latin typefaces. The ductus references according to the lines of a Didone typeface add a touch of Sinhala form to certain terminations. Large counters have been added along with small ascenders and descenders for optimized screen viewing. The project is led by Mooniak , a small type foundry based in Colombo, Sri Lanka, in collaboration with Pushpananda Ekanayake . The Latin part is designed by Sol Matas . Initial development and release was funded by Google Fonts in 2015. For more information and updates, or to report any bugs or suggestions, see github.com/mooniak/abhaya-libre-font",

      "description": "Aboreto is a display typeface based on early renaissance majuscule alphabet done by Luca della Robbia, a 15th century Florentine sculptor. The typeface is not a straightforward digitalization (it even couldn’t be as the early Latin alphabet didn’t include all the letters we use today) but more of a revival which keeps current needs and technologies in mind. Aboreto has vertical stress, a feature more typical of later-century typefaces. Another uniqueness lies in the construction, because it is essentially a sans-serif typeface that has only occasional indication of serifs – either via the “hidden” serifs caused by stroke tapering or by slightly thickening the stroke endings. Aboreto comes in one weight - a high contrast regular that is on the thinner side. To contribute, see github.com/domija/Aboreto .",

The titling weights are a contemporary revamp of classic Didone styles, display both neutrality and strong presence on the page to attract reader attention with measured tension by its curves, good color and high contrast. Abril Fatface in particular is inspired by the heavy titling fonts used in advertising posters in 19th century Britain and France. The thin serifs and clean curves lend the typeface a refined touch that give any headline an elegant appearance. The Extended Latin character set supports over 50 languages, including those from Central and Northern Europe. Abril is designed by TypeTogether - Veronika Burian & José Scaglione.

The idea was to learn through the creation of a typeface about writing as an information carrier. It was created entirely digitally, so the path to the current version is very rocky and winding. Actor has a strong x-height, which is why it always requires a fairly high line spacing. The digits of Actor are created as old style figures. The forms of 6 and 9 are more dynamic and more tense than usual. The 8 has significantly shifted interiors and the 7 is slightly curved to the left.",

(ROS stands for /Registry, /Ordering, and /Supplement, and refers to the /CIDSystemInfo dictionary entries that define the glyph set name for CID-based character collections.) The Adobe-Identity-0 ROS is a special-purpose character collection whose use is not tied to a specific language, and Adobe Blank 2 is a special-purpose OpenType font that is intended to render all Unicode code points using non-spacing and non-marking glyphs, thus the reason why the Adobe-Identity-0 ROS was chosen as the basis for this OpenType font. Adobe Blank maps 1,111,998 Unicode code points to 2,048 non-spacing and non-marking glyphs (CIDs 1 through 2048). The 2,048 High and Low Surrogates (U+D800 through U+DFFF), the two noncharacters in the BMP and in each of the 16 Supplementary Planes (FFFE and FFFF), and the 32 noncharacters in the range U+FDD0 through U+FDEF are explicitly and intentionally excluded. As a fully-functional OpenType font, the following 10 'sfnt' tables are included in an OTF format version of the font: CFF, DSIG, OS/2, cmap, head, hhea, hmtx, maxp, name, and post. In addition to a functional OpenType/CFF font, Adobe provides a TrueType (TTF) version that is available here (with a slight modification to the PostScript Name in the 'name' table from 'AdobeBlank' to 'AdobeBlank-Regular'.)

The characters flow into each other, making a very saucy script with appetizing color. The narrow lowercase allows for efficient use of space, while the long ascenders and descenders help maintain the legibility. A unique find among scripts, Aguafina is useful for product packaging, glossy magazine work, and book covers.",

It was also selected in the 2nd Bienal Iberoamericana de Diseño, competition held in Madrid in 2010. Alegreya is a typeface originally intended for literature. Among its crowning characteristics, it conveys a dynamic and varied rhythm which facilitates the reading of long texts. Also, it provides freshness to the page while referring to the calligraphic letter, not as a literal interpretation, but rather in a contemporary typographic language. The italic has just as much care and attention to detail in the design as the roman. The bold weights are strong, and the Black weights are really experimental for the genre. There is also a Small Caps sibling family. Not only does Alegreya provide great performance, but also achieves a strong and harmonious text by means of elements designed in an atmosphere of diversity. The Alegreya type system is a \"super family\", originally intended for literature, and includes serif and sans serif sister families. Designed by Juan Pablo del Peral for Huerta Tipográfica .

      "description": "Alegreya was chosen as one of 53 \"Fonts of the Decade\" at the ATypI Letter2 competition in September 2011, and one of the top 14 text type systems. It was also selected in the 2nd Bienal Iberoamericana de Diseño, competition held in Madrid in 2010. Alegreya is a typeface originally intended for literature. Among its crowning characteristics, it conveys a dynamic and varied rhythm which facilitates the reading of long texts. Also, it provides freshness to the page while referring to the calligraphic letter, not as a literal interpretation, but rather in a contemporary typographic language. The italic has just as much care and attention to detail in the design as the roman. The bold weights are strong, and the Black weights are really experimental for the genre. This is the Small Caps sister family that complements Alegreya , the main family. Not only does Alegreya provide great performance, but also achieves a strong and harmonious text by means of elements designed in an atmosphere of diversity. The Alegreya type system is a \"super family\", originally intended for literature, and includes serif and sans serif sister families. Designed by Juan Pablo del Peral for Huerta Tipográfica .

Amiri is a revival of the beautiful typeface pioneered in early 20th century by Bulaq Press in Cairo, also known as Amiria Press, after which the font is named. The uniqueness of this typeface comes from its superb balance between the beauty of Naskh calligraphy on one hand, the constraints and requirements of elegant typography on the other. Also, it is one of the few metal typefaces that were used in typesetting the Koran, making it a good source for a digital typeface to be used in typesetting Koranic verses. Amiri project aims at the revival of the aesthetics and traditions of Arabic typesetting, and adapting it to the era of digital typesetting, in a publicly available form.

Open spacing and stylish letterforms lend themselves to titling, but also to clean legibility at smaller sizes as body copy. The Devanagari is a traditionally calligraphic style. The combination was designed by Eduardo Tunni. This project is led by Eduardo Tunni, a type designer based in Buenos Aires. To contribute, see github.com/etunni/Amita",

      "description": "Andika is a sans serif, Unicode-compliant font designed especially for literacy use, taking into account the needs of beginning readers. The focus is on clear, easy-to-perceive letterforms that will not be readily confused with one another. Starting with an initial draft of a basic lowercase Latin alphabet by Victor Gaultney, Annie Olsen refined the design and added over 4,700 glyphs, including a complete extended Cyrillic set. A sans serif font is preferred by some literacy personnel for teaching people to read. Its forms are simpler and less cluttered than those of most serif fonts. For years, literacy workers have had to make do with fonts that were not really suitable for beginning readers and writers. In some cases, literacy specialists have had to tediously assemble letters from a variety of fonts in order to get all of the characters they need for their particular language project, resulting in confusing and unattractive publications. Andika addresses those issues. The font has been upgraded in May 2022. This upgrade gives additional weight styles and expands the glyphset to support full Latin and Cyrillic characters sets. Rendering is also much improved. Read more at software.sil.org/andika To contribute, see github.com/silnrsi/font-andika .",

A well-informed, conscientious and refreshing interpretation of India’s letter traditions, this family offers a versatile system that can meet the demands of a wide range of applications. Its expansive design space allows Anek to don multiple personalities. At its most condensed, capsular forms keep structures compact for that graphic texture.

A well-informed, conscientious and refreshing interpretation of India’s letter traditions, this family offers a versatile system that can meet the demands of a wide range of applications. Its expansive design space allows Anek to don multiple personalities. At its most condensed, capsular forms keep structures compact for that graphic texture. On the wide end of the spectrum, the extra legroom lets each letter yawn and stretch into their message. But it is in the boldest weights that Anek comes alive.

Anek comes in ten scripts : Bangla, Devanagari, Kannada, Latin, Gujarati, Gurmukhi, Malayalam, Odia, Tamil and Telugu.

Legibility is always a central concern, but the design has a lot of personality to be recognizable as a display font to be used in headlines, brand names, and similar uses on the web. The primary goal was to create a design that will prove popular because it resonates with both casual and professional designers, and without ever lowering the quality of the design. Each font in the family was extensively tested on low resolution phones and refined to work well as a web font in the mobile era. From the very first round of design testing, each font was hinted with ttfautohint and refined for Windows users. Arima Madurai has an extended language support for the Tamil and Latin scripts, as well as Malayalam and Greek. Greek developed during Google Summer of Code 2017 by Rosalie Wagner, under the mentorship of Emilios Theofanous and Irene Vlachou.\" The Arima project is led by NDISCOVER, a type design foundry based in Portugal.

      "description": "Arvo is a geometric slab-serif typeface family suited for screen and print. The family includes 4 cuts: Roman, Italic, Roman Bold, Bold Italic. It is a libre font, first published in Google Fonts. The flavour of the font is rather mixed. It's monolinear-ish, but has a tiny bit of contrast (which increases the legibility a little in Mac OS X.) The name Arvo is a typical Estonian man's name, but is not widely used today. In the Finnish language, Arvo means \"number, value, worth.\" Considering how much programming is involved in hinting, all these meanings are true. In December 2013 Arvo 2.0.1 was released, with support for languages that use the Cyrillic script, the latin script is expanded to Adobe's Glyph List 3, and many truetype hints are improved especially for in smaller sizes (regular cuts start now from 9ppem). Also added PANOSE classification numbers, cleaned up character palette order, and many more smaller bug fixes were made. Updated August 2015: Bold and Bold Italic styles were updated to allow document embedding. Arvo – это брусковый шрифт из семейства геометрических шрифтов с прямоугольными засечками. Данный шрифт создан для использования на экранах, а также в печатном виде (офсетная печать и т.д). Шрифт состоит из четырёх начертании: обычный, курсив, жирный и жирный курсив.Arvo распространяется на основании лицензии OFL. Благодаря которой любой пользователь может скачать/загрузить данное семейство шрифтов и пользоваться ими по своему усмотрению (смотри подробнее scripts.sil.org/OFL ). Для улучения читаемости на экранах, шрифт имеет детальное оптимирование Truetype (хинтинг), что в системах Windows и Linux предоставляет возможность набора мелкого шрифта, не теряя при этом качества читаемости. Краткая биография Антон Коовит родился в 1981 году, в городе Таллинне.

The design is meant to work well with long texts while maintaining a certain charm at large sizes. Asar is partially derived from Pria Ravichadran's Palanquin , starting by interpreting that design's overall proportions and heart lines and glyph set and OpenType features. The design arrives at its own identity by adjusting for the density of certain brush strokes, that dictate wider spacing and new forms. The brush used is the Expand Path feature of Fontlab Studio 5, using a width of 93, an angle of -55, and a roundness of 35. In general the letters are designed so as to not require further adjustment, but where this is not satisfying then manual adjustments are made. This project is led by Sorkin Type, an international type foundry based in Boston. To contribute, see github.com/EbenSorkin/Asar",

      "description": "Athiti is a Thai word for the Sun, and it is an informal sans Latin and loopless Thai typeface. The friendly personality is based on humanist calligraphy, and has an organic look and feel while preserving the traditional construction of Roman type. It all started with a desire to learn more about the origin of strokes in human handwriting. It is designed to reflect a trace of writing tools and convey its inspiration. The family consists of 6 weights that can be used in headlines or body text. The outer curves contrast with the angled inner counter shapes, which distributes feelings of strength and softness at the same time. Athiti can be used with a mixture of formal and informal content, for example in educational work. A similarity between some glyphs such as ก ถ ภ ฤ ฦ, ฎ ฏ, บ ป, or ข ช is something to take into consideration because it might lead to confusion when typesetting very short texts. A specific approach has been taken for dealing with thick and thin strokes in the Thai design. Other type designers may consider this font as an example when developing new fonts. Informal loopless Thai typefaces have slightly simplified details, as compared to the formal looped style, and this allows type designers to extend loopless families to very black weights. Sizes and positions of vowels and tone marks need to be managed carefully because they are all relevant to readability, legibility, and overall texture. Also, in this case, ink trapping is required when connecting two specific strokes of each glyph, and it has to be done carefully, as it has been in Athiti. The Athiti project is led by Cadson Demak, a type foundry in Thailand. To contribute, see github.com/cadsondemak/athiti",

The idea was to design an average font for use in text, through a lengthy process of shape measurement and data gathering in spreadsheets. This resulted in a series of parameters which could be used by a designer to determine the proportions, color, spacing and other attributes of a typeface. Once the parameters were defined and best values were selected, the forms for the Average Regular typeface were drawn. In september 2022, Average has been updated to provide a larger glyphset and therefore greater language support. A sans sister family, Average Sans , is also available.

In 2010, Airbus initiated a research collaboration with ENAC and Université de Toulouse III on a prospective study to define and validate an “Aeronautical Font”: the challenge was to improve the display of textual data information on all cockpit screens, concerning more specifically legibility, readability and reading comfort, and to enhance the overall cockpit consistency.

      "description": "Badeen Display isn’t just another typeface—it’s a bold, unapologetic move that challenges the conventions of Arabic typography. Think of it as a bridge between the energy of youth culture and the richness of Arab pop heritage. Badeen Display lives in the space between contrasts, blending thick and thin strokes with a purpose, bringing together soft, rounded forms and sharp, assertive edges. It’s designed to do more than just look good; it’s here to create an impact, to grab attention, and to express a sense of personality that’s both grounded and forward-thinking. This is the font for creators who want to make a statement, who want every letter to have meaning and every word to stand out. Badeen Display is about embodying a vibrant character in a way that’s contemporary, yet unmistakably rooted in culture. It’s a tool to bring your brand to life, to speak with authenticity and clarity, and to capture the spirit of something timeless yet completely new. When you choose Badeen Display, you’re not just choosing a font—you’re making a creative decision to stand out, to resonate, and to inspire.

Unusually this type includes lowercase letters. The high x-height gives the text a compact look, true to the original Cooperplate Gothic design. The general form is less condensed. It has diagonal stress, and a soft variation in contrast to improve legibility. It is bolder than normal for better rasterization on screen. The typeface works smoothly at text sizes with its delicate serifs, which gives a crisp effect on the screen. At larger sizes it shows a strong personality with the combination of serif details and the modulation of its strokes. It is useful for both short text and headlines, but it is also comfortable for reading on screen. Designed by Dario Muhafara for tipo foundry .",

It is characterized by expressive, flowing, and bulging curves, mannered awkwardness, and the bobbles on the terminals of its characters. The ‘modern face’ type genre is the typographical equivalent, and it can be found in books printed throughout the nineteenth century. This genre survived in educational textbooks produced throughout the twentieth century, and is preserved in computer science as the style which Donald Knuth adopted for his T E X typesetting system . Bentham is a half-way design; true neither to the type produced during the nineteenth century, nor to the letterforms of cartographers, stonecutters, or engravers. Really it is an examination of the characteristics that these letters share, colored by Ben's approach to type drawing.",

      "description": "Biryani (बिरयानी) is a libre font development project. Its fonts are designed in a monolinear, geometric sans serif style. Like several early geometric sans typefaces from the last century, Biryani’s characters have a strong flavor to them; they are more wonky than sterile. Biryani’s fonts are indeed meant for text, just not necessarily for very long, immersive reading-length passages. The letterforms are a bit too “display” for that. Currently, the Biryani fonts support the Latin and Devangari scripts, meaning that Indian languages like Hindi, Marathi, and Nepali may be set with the fonts, in addition to most Western and Central European languages. The Biryani project is led by Dan Reynolds, a type designer based in Berlin, Germany. To contribute, visit github.com/typeoff/biryani",

      "description": "People read and interact with text on screens more and more each day. What happens on screen ends up being more important than what comes out of the printer. With the accelerating popularity of electronic books, type designers are working hard to seek out the ideal designs for reading on screen. Motivated by her love for the pixel, Sol Matas designed Bitter. A \"contemporary\" slab serif typeface for text, it is specially designed for comfortably reading on any computer or device. The robust design started from the austerity of the pixel grid, based on rational rather than emotional principles. It combines the large x-heights and legibility of the humanistic tradition with subtle characteristics in the characters that inject a certain rhythm to flowing texts. Bitter has little variation in stroke weight and the Regular style is thicker than a usual ‘Regular’ style for print design. This generates an intense color in paragraphs, accentuated by the serifs that are as thick as strokes with square terminals. Each glyph is carefully designed with an excellent curve quality added to the first stage of the design, that was entirely made in a pixel grid. The typeface is balanced and manually spaced to use very few kerning pairs. To contribute, see github.com/solmatas/BitterPro .",

      "description": "Bricolage Grotesque is a collage of lots of different things: historical sources, technical decisions and personal feelings. It started as a fork of Mayenne Sans , an open-source single weight font designed by Jérémy Landes (Studio Triple). It evolved by reinforcing cues from French sources and British sources: the compressed weights lean more towards the anxious and wonky tones of Grotesque Nº9 and the regular weights have a bit more of Antique Olive's relaxed and confident attitude. The smaller optical sizes become more neutral and reflective of contemporary sans serifs, notably through the use of exaggerated ink traps. By blending iconic British and French designs with modern trends and tools, it aims to traverse a complex typographical and emotional landscape. At the same time, it’s so steeped in historical sources and references that it’s hard to call it anything but a re-interpretation of the same ideas but for a different purpose: trying to express visually what it feels like to move countries and rebuild, what it feels like to have a hybrid identity where you cannot be what you were and yet you can never truly be anybody else.

      "description": "The Cantarell typeface family was designed during Dave Crossland's study of MA Typeface Design in 2009 in the Department of Typography at the University of Reading (UK). The typeface is designed as a contemporary Humanist sans serif, and was developed for on-screen reading; in particular, reading web pages on an HTC Dream mobile phone. This family was developed using only open-source softwares, mainly FontForge. Typeface designs are tools too, and therefore these font files are licensed in a way that respects your freedom — you are invited to extend them to meet your needs, such as to add the glyphs missing from your own writing systems, under the terms of the Open Font License. In October 2022 some metadata were fixed such as license clification, style name and style linking. Users may notice that the style \"Oblique\" has changed to \"Italic\".

It has reminiscences of hand lettering, mixing straight and bowed stems, and natural curves. It was born as an experiment in drawing from the outside to the inside (drawing the space surrounding the letters first, instead of drawing the letters themselves) in trying to apply the ideas and methods of Michael Harvey and Evert Bloemsma to my own glyphs construction. In 0ctober 2022 naming inconcistencies between the font file and the API were fixed, users maybe cautious with using this update as the font name now aligns with the family name displayed by the API: Cantora One (instead of CantoraOne). Although Cantora is a sans, the lowercase letters have serif proportions. It's perfect for headlines (H1, H2, H3) in sizes larger than 20px.",

Skeletons of the most characteristic glyphs are inspired by quick handwriting and based on a single hand movement (G,a,g,k,e). Capriola ambitiously seeks to push the boundaries of originality in the genre without losing legibility. The unusual glyphs are quite noticeable in large sizes which allows for distinctive headlines. However in small sizes these gestures become less noticeable, making it possible to set longer texts. The name means somersault in Latin. The a, e and G are the real acrobats, and the \"g\" makes a double salto! Capriola was spaced for use on the web. Capriola's originality combined with utility makes it ideal for a wide range of uses.

The default style is a grotesque with straight stems. As the flair axis grows the straight grotesque terminals develop a swelling and become almost glyphic serifs and the joints become more idiosyncratic. The volume axis transforms the glyphic serifs to wedge-like ones. Each voice of Commissioner comes in a range of styles from Thin to Black including italics. The diverse proportions of lowercase and capitals add warmth and appeal to texts across sizes, while the different voices can express a variation in the typographic texture that ranges from delicate in text sizes to exuberant in larger sizes.

It was created by two designers with very different ideas, who took advantage of their divergent criteria to draw glyphs that made the Upright and Italic styles converge without mixing them. In this way, it was possible to converge the inclination of an Upright Sans Serif with a Sans Serif Italic. Looking at the font in detail, the bottom halves of the glyphs have Transitive serifs while the upper halves conserve the Sans Serif terminals. Other specific details can be seen in the a, g, and e glyphs, which have an Italic structure, not an Upright one. In addition, the glyph for the letter r has a relatively closed instroke. The references used to develop this font were Bree from TypeTogether, Parisine de Porchez Typofonderie, and, undeniably, Ludovico Degli Arrighi's manuscript about the structure the \"humanistic cursive\" that is Convergence.

The project currently comprises a total of 45 font files spanning 9 different visual styles (Roman, Italic, Infant, Infant Italic, Garamond, Garamond Italic, Upright Cursive, Small Caps, and Unicase) and 5 weights (Light, Regular, Medium, SemiBold, and Bold.) Cormorant was conceived, drawn, spaced, kerned, programmed, interpolated, and produced in its entirety by Christian Thalmann of Catharsis Fonts. For an illustrated presentation and description of the family, please visit its B&#275;hance page .

The first Crimson design was initiated by Sebastian Kosch in 2009, and he later completely redrew a new version called Crimson Prime. Google commissioned Jacques Le Bailly to review both typefaces, and develop Crimson Pro as a new design that synthesises both designs into a final authoritative family, first released in January 2019. All decisions were made to enable better readability for longer texts and the ability to make good and diverse typography. The Crimson Pro project is led by Jacques Le Bailly, a type designer based in Den Haag, Netherlands. To contribute, see github.com/Fonthausen/CrimsonPro",

Crimson Text is inspired by the fantastic work of people like Jan Tschichold, Robert Slimbach and Jonathan Hoefler. We hope that the free type community will one day be able to enjoy Crimson Text as a beautiful workhorse. Several important bug fixes have been brought in March 2022, including the harmonisation of the line-spacing across all styles. To contribute, see github.com/googlefonts/Crimson .",

David Hadash Formal is a modern digitization made from original large scale technical drawings for the typeface drawn by Ismar David. Google has worked with Monotype to release the 3 book weights (Regular, Medium and Bold) under the SIL Open Font License and create a new version for use by the public. This project includes working with the David Hadash sources to create a new version, that fits the requirements of Israeli instituions, since David is the official font for Israeli correspondence. Some glyphs were updated, such as the Sheqel symbol. It was redesigned to be recognizable by contemporary Hebrew readers, since the original Sheqel symbol is too far from today's standard. Latin characters from the Gentium typeface were derived and integrated to accommodate cases in which Latin and Hebrew characters will be used in tandem. Each font includes OpenType features required for diacritic marks (nikud) and Hebrew-specific uses, including alternative Hebrew-height numerals (available as Stylistic Set 1) an alternative \"Hebrew ampersand\" symbol designed by Ismar David (available in Stylistic Set 2) and an alternative Sheqel symbol designed by Ismar David (available in Stylistic Set 3.) Every effort was made to keep the original designs intact, and the type's original spacing is well preserved. However, several changes have been made to fit with David Libre's goal to be used as a free alternative to the David font commonly installed on PCs. In order to be compatible with documents previously set in the version of David bundled with Microsoft Windows, David Hadash's glyph size has been reduced by 12.5%. This was made to prevent cases in which documents previously typed in Microsoft's David to take up more pages and cause odd line breaks. Please note that this does not guarantee full compatibility with that David, only a close approximation. Diacritic marks have been repositioned. Biblical cantillation marks are not supported. The construction of David Libre was made by Meir Sadan, commissioned by Google for the Google Fonts project. The David Libre project is led by Meir Sadan, a type designer based in Tel Aviv, Israel.

Its style, similar to Bodoni, has a remarkable degree of horizontal expansion; a weight which indicates verticality; areas between serif and stem softened by a curve connecting them, and the light in the main stroke of each glyph is a detail that lightens up and gives prominence to Diplomata. It is a distinct typeface, ideal for composing headlines and small prestigious pieces of text. The February 2023 update features a bigger glyphset, fractions and some minor aesthetic modifications.

It was designed by Colophon Foundry (UK), that started from the Latin portion of Adobe Source Serif 4 , by Frank Grießhammer et al. To contribute, see github.com/googlefonts/dm-fonts",

      "description": "From the very first steps in the design process, Domine was designed, tested and optimized for body text on the web. Harmless to the eyes when reading long texts, Domine is a perfect choice for newspapers or magazines websites, where text is the main focus. It shines at px sizes 14 and 16, and can even be used as small as 11 px. Friendly in appearance, it combines the classic elements of familiar typefaces that have been in use from more than 100 years like Clarendon , Century , Cheltenham and Clearface . The rounded letters (b, c, d, e, o, p, q) are a bit squarish on the inside. This feature opens up the counters for better rendering and also make it look a bit more up-to-date than the classic typefaces previously referenced. The serifs are a bit shorter than usual. Another feature that improves the rendering by allowing more \"air\" between each letter pair. The joins of the stems to the branches in letters like h, m, n are deep enough to prevent dark spots, also improving legibility at small sizes. The friendly lowercase 'a', with the curve starting from the bottom of the stem, is reminiscent of Cheltenham and Clearface. That soft curve is also echoed in the curves of the f, j, n, m and r. The spacing is also optimized for body text on the web, clearly more open than that of typefaces made for print or for headlines. To contribute, see github.com/googlefonts/Dominee .",

I first spotted it in an architecture book at my college's library while doing homework. Dorsa is a modern interpretation of Empire with some personal details. When I start sketching I knew it would be a little less condensed than the original Empire because I wanted it to be used for use in titles, and combined with positive letter spacing it gives an elegant look to text. Although the original hasn't got a lowercase, I studied a lot of skyline typefaces and drew a fully original lowercase. I started with lowercase “o”, which isn't completely geometric, it is expanded to the outside, keeping the same whitespace through all weights. And this repeats all over the typeface, because the construction of all the characters was modular, based on that “o”; the “f” is designed to not meet any of the diacritics; and uppercase “A” has a traditional form, because I think this is more legible.",

From the early 1930s through World War II, there were about 200 professional hand letterers working in New York City alone. This occupation saw its demise with the advent of photo lettering, and after digital typography it became virtually extinct. The odd way in which the Bluemlein scripts were assembled and created - by collecting different signatures and then building complete alphabets from them - is a fascinating calligraphic adventure. Because the set of constructed designs looked nothing like the original signatures, fictitious names were assigned to the new script typefaces. The typeface styles were then showcased in Higgins Ink catalogs. Alejandro Paul and Sudtipos bring the Bluemlein scripts back to life in a set of expanded digital versions, reflecting the demands of today’s designer. Extreme care has been taken to render the original scripts authentically, keeping the fictitious names originally assigned to them by Bluemlein.",

      "description": "EB Garamond is intended to be an excellent, classical, Garamond. It is a community project to create a revival of Claude Garamont’s famous humanist typefaces from the mid-16th century. This digital version reproduces the original design by Claude Garamont closely: The source for the letterforms is a scan of a specimen known as the “Berner specimen,” which was composed in 1592 by Conrad Berner, the son-in-law of Christian Egenolff and his successor at the Egenolff print office. This specimen shows Garamont’s roman and Granjon’s italic types at different sizes. Hence the name of this project: Egenolff-Berner Garamond. Why another Garamond? That typeface is a key moment in the history of typography, and European type designers have been reacting to this work ever since. It is probably the most revived typeface in the world and many are excellent. In the world of free/libre culture, however, only a few Garamond-inspired types exist, and none share the scope of this project. In November 2019, the family has been updated to a variable font family. This project is led by Georg Duffner, and developed at github.com/georgd/EB-Garamond",

The development of the typeface took most of 2007 and received the assistance of type design colleagues from all over Latin America. Economica has four basic styles: Regular, Bold, Italic and Bold Italic. It includes a comprehensive character set that lets you work with diverse European languages. This typeface family was designed for the output of inkjet printers. It was inspired by the concept of saving space in publishing texts without loss of height. This means it is a very condensed type. The visual advantage of Economica is that accomplishes this horizontal compression while keeping a strong personality. It is not a typical, neutral, sans serif. The open forms and tendency towards flattened curves allow it to be used in very small spaces while retaining high legibility. To contribute to the project contact Vicente Lamónaca .",

Eczar was designed to bring liveliness and vigor to multi-script typesetting in Latin and Devanagari – with the intention of providing an alternative to existing designs by imparting a strong mix of personality and performance, both at text sizes and in display settings. The family offers a wide expressive range and the display qualities of the design intensify with corresponding increase in weight, making the heaviest weights best suited for headlines and display purposes.

It has an accurate techno character, holds the baseline well because of its rectangular modular-based construction. At display sizes its detailing in terminals become noticeable. It is optimized for screen, and will work well in print thank to its simple and straight outlines.",

      "description": "El Messiri is a modern Arabic typeface family designed by Mohamed Gaber (Arabic) that began with Jovanny Lemonad's Latin and Cyrillic typeface Philosopher . The Arabic started with the concept of a curvy Arabic typeface inspired by the beauty of Naskh and drawn as if with a brush instead of the traditional bamboo pen. The idea took form with wide counters that improve readability at smaller text sizes, and has subtle details that make it a great display face at larger sizes. El Messiri current comes in 4 weights (Light, Regular, SemiBold and Bold) and the Arabic component has a wide glyph set that supports the Arabic, Farsi and Urdu languages. The font has been upgraded to a variable font with a weight axis (Regular to Bold) in August 2021. To contribute, see github.com/Gue3bara/El-Messiri",

It offers personality, readability and economy. One of the most important features of Esteban is its stroke, that loses or gains weight in the stems. This feature was defined from the manuscripts of Jorge Alfredo Díaz Esteban, a writer who used a tool that can generate modulated strokes. This means the stroke width varies due to the pressure of the pen on the paper, and this quality allows the font to have a presence on the page that makes texts more dynamic. The precise level of contrast was decided by experimenting with various 'colors' of density that emerge in text settings. This allows Esteban to achieve good performance even in medium and low quality prints and as a web font.",

The main challenge of designing a modern interpretation was to balance between applying visual corrections for overall consistency and staying close to the original source. In certain cases the historical authenticy was sacrificed in favour of an even typographic color. This project required research of historic type specimens in search for the missing letterforms. The unusual interpretation of the Yen currency symbol can be found in typefaces of that period. Designed by Olexa M.Volochay, Alexei Vanyashin for Cyreal. To contribute to the project, visit github.com/cyrealtype/Federant Updated: February 2016 to Version 1.011, to correct the GPOS table (enabling kerning, so the horizontal metrics may change, causing some reflow in Firefox where kerning is used by default.)",

Your eye spends a non-zero amount of energy to scan, parse and join multiple characters into a single logical one. Ideally, all programming languages should be designed with full-fledged Unicode symbols for operators, but that’s not the case yet. Fira Code is an extension of the Fira Mono font containing a set of ligatures for common programming multi-character combinations. This is just a font rendering feature: underlying code remains ASCII-compatible. This helps to read and understand code faster.

Fjord features sturdy construction, prominent serifs, low-contrast modulation and long elegant ascenders and descenders relative to the 'x' height. Fjord performs well in sizes form 12 px and higher but because of its original design and careful detailing Fjord can also be a distinctive font choice for larger text headlines and in corporate design.

Frank Rühl was designed in 1908 by Rafael Frank in collaboration with Auto Rühl of the C. F. Rühl foundry of Leipzig. A final version was released in 1910. Many Israeli books, newspapers and magazines use Frank Rühl as their main body text typeface. Made to accommodate the growing need for typefaces in secular Hebrew writings, the typeface was fitted to modern printing demands and designed to be readable in longform text, with and without vowel marks. Frank Rühl has Sephardi proportions (mem-height is approximately 4½ stroke widths), and is based roughly on Venetian typefaces used by printer Daniel Bomberg. Frank wrote of his design that he wishes to combine the simpleness of Antiqua with the \"pleasantness\" of Fraktur, leading him to \"quieten\" the letterforms by reducing the contrast between its thin and thick strokes. This newly designed revival by Yanek Iontef is a family of 7 weights, Light to Black (the original typeface had only one) and in November 2022, it became variable and offers a larger choice of weights.

The typeface uniquely balances modernization with the authentic elements of Arabic script. It supports a large number of languages that use Arabic script, and includes a number of OpenType features for finer typography, including stylistic sets, proportional and tabular digits, super/subscripts, and fractions. Additionally, Fustat is a variable that providing dynamic flexibility for various design applications, and includes seven pre-defined weight instances: ExtraLight, Light, Regular, Medium, SemiBold, Bold, and ExtraBold. Fustat Latin designed by Laura Garcia Mut, was developed to match the Arabic script, implementing features and subtle details from the Arabic strokes and flows. With a mix of simple grotesque structure and other geometric forms, it is a very low-contrast sans serif family with a neutral and kind texture. With a high x-height, it works in many sizes and purposes, allowing compact consistency. It supports a Latin Extended glyph set, and includes many OpenType features and Stylistic Sets with alternate geometric forms and tailed ends, looking for a more connected feeling. Fustat is optimized for web usage, offering an authentic yet contemporary presence online. It is ideal for titles due to its distinct style, yet it also performs well in body text, ensuring readability. This makes it perfect for creating a strong, authentic brand identity with a modern twist. The typeface supports both Arabic and Latin scripts, making it versatile for bilingual design projects. Its extensive character set and the manuscript-inspired modern approach to Kufi style ensure that it meets diverse design needs. Published under the Open Font License (OFL), Fustat promotes free and open use while ensuring quality and consistency. Embrace the rich heritage of the Kufi manuscript style with the modern versatility of Fustat, the go-to typeface for authentic and contemporary Arabic design.

It has soft variation in its contrast, diagonal stress and open forms to improve legibility. The relation between x-height, ascender and descenders gives the text a bright color on the screen. It has only the necessary curves and it is a little darker for better rasterization. The typeface works smooth at text sizes and shows strong personality in larger sizes too. It is best recommended for short text and headlines, but it is also comfortable for reading on screen. Designed by Dario Muhafara for tipo foundry .",

The thick strokes fill up the embox, but by giving the right angle at the end of stroke to match with Hangeul characteristics, the font has natural counter spaces with good legibility.

Its design was inspired by an original printed sample of a French Transitional typeface which follows the Romain Du Roi typeface introduced in 1702. As a transitional type, it is marked by an interest in rational planning and it has a tension between rigor and expression. It feels generally formal and rational but its rounded terminals make it more contemporary and friendly. It also offers an occasional flourish, especially in the italics. The June 2022 update offers an major language support update. In March 2024, the glyph set for GF Africa Pri has been enhanced with improved diacritics, along with the addition of some other basic language support from the 'Beyond' glyph set. Updates were also made to currency symbols, other symbols, spaces, and NSM localization. To contribute, see github.com/SorkinType/Gelasio .",

This font family has been improved in many ways over FM Gemunu during the Unicode adaptation process by acquiring more breathing space, bigger counters and smooth uniformity in curves. What sets Gemunu Libre apart from all the other Sinhala typefaces currently in use is the distinctive smooth and square edge, which was perfected whilst completely redrawing the set of characters in order to cater to the requirements of web and screens. Gemunu Libre comes in 7 weights from Extra Light to Extra Bold, and each weight contains the complete Sinhala script and a matching Latin characters. The project is led by Mooniak in collaboration with Pushpananda Ekanayake. Latin set is designed by Sol Matas. Initial development and release was funded by Google Fonts in 2015.

It’s a simple geometric typeface in the mould of some of the experimental faces designed during the 1920s by well-known modernist designers such as Theo van Doesberg and Herbert Bayer. This style found a strong echo in designs of Neville Brody in the 1980s, which are now identified as an expression of the consumer culture of that decade. During the 1990s the magazine and font catalogue Emigre was at the public front of typeface design, and was a place where computer fonts with this same look appeared. I think Geo expresses both the directness of some of the 1920s faces and the rather disingenuous consumerist thrust of the 1980s and 1990s descendants of theirs.",

The typeface eventually arrived in Greece, with the field press which came with Didot’s grandson Ambroise Firmin Didot, during the Greek Revolution in 1821. Since then the typeface enjoyed an unrivaled success as the type of choice for almost every kind of publication, until the last decades of the 20th century. Didot’s type was the base for a new font, GFS Didot (1994), which was designed by Takis Katsoulidis, and digitised by George Matthiopoulos, of the Greek Font Society . The typeface is accompanied by a matching Latin design, inspired by Hermann Zapf’s Palatino .",

      "description": "The design of new Greek typefaces always followed the growing needs of the Classical Studies in the major European Universities. Furthermore, by the end of the 19th century bibliology had become an established section of Historical Studies, and, as John Bowman commented, the prevailing attitude was that Greek types should adhere to a lost idealized, yet undefined, greekness of yore. Especially in Great Britain this tendency remained unchallenged in the first decades of the 20th century, both by Richard Proctor, curator of the incunabula section in the British Museum Library and his successor Victor Scholderer. In 1927, Scholderer, on behalf of the Society for the Promotion of Greek Studies, got involved in choosing and consulting the design and production of a Greek type called New Hellenic cut by the Lanston Monotype Corporation. He chose the revival of a round, and almost monoline type which had first appeared in 1492 in the edition of Macrobius, ascribable to the printing shop of Giovanni Rosso (Joannes Rubeus) in Venice. New Hellenic was the only successful typeface in Great Britain after the introduction of Porson Greek well over a century before. The type, since to 1930’s, was also well received in Greece, albeit with a different design for Ξ and Ω. GFS digitized the typeface (1993-1994) funded by the Athens Archeological Society with the addition of a new set of epigraphical symbols. Later (2000) more weights were added (italic, bold and bold italic) as well as a latin version.",

It attempts to collect, synthesize, and lovingly evoke the identity and spirit of the region in which the original forms were encountered, while acknowledging my own relationship to and presence in the place and the design. The primary characteristics that define Girassol include its condensed proportions, moderate contrast following the expansion model, a thorny, decorative serif construction that pierces the baseline and cap height, and playful flourishes that mimic the decoration possible in hand-painted signage. Numerous discretionary ligatures play on the typeface's angular and thorny construction to evoke a sense of improvisation in the signs on which the forms are based. The smallcaps are the result of my effort to capture the secondary style found in the Carcavelos signs. My approach to the smallcaps lead to a set of letters that perfectly complements the main caps but which simultaneously becomes softer and more gentle because of its more square proportion. Girassol feels at home set in large, striking titles and smaller graphical vignettes. To contribute, see github.com/liamspradlin/Girassol-Display .",

Though the Devanagari is penned with a traditional canted nib, the structures are improvised with an expressive whim that belies conventions of structure and challenges notions of consistency. Swooping calligraphic strokes inspire forms that are lyrical without being too opulent. The same spirit resonates within a modulated sans serif style Latin as letters retain a calligraphic stress and keep the delicate typographic quirks. Furnished with such typographic subtleties, Gotu can lend its distinct style to a quaint monograph, a striking headline, an ornate invite or even a chic brand.

Thus the following words from Monotype specimen books are just: “[W]hen composed into words the characters appear to lock into one another with a closeness common in early types, but not so often seen in later-day creations.” These are letters that take command of the space around them; notice, for instance, the bowed shapes of the v and w.",

      "description": "Gulzar is a contemporary Urdu Nasta’liq typeface – and its Latin counterpart – designed and developed through a collaboration by Borna Izadpanah (Principal Designer and Project Leader), Simon Cozens (Font Engineering), Alice Savoie (Designer, Gulzar Latin), Fiona Ross (Consultant, Gulzar Urdu), Amir Mahdi Moslehi (Calligraphic adviser, Gulzar Urdu) and Martin Dodds (Consultant, Gulzar Urdu). This typeface was designed to provide an effective textual communication tool primarily for Urdu readers on digital platforms and in print. In Gulzar, the aim has been to produce a typeface which is legible at text sizes and suitable for sustained reading. The first phase of this project involved conducting research into the history of Urdu digital typefaces from the early 1980s. The design of Gulzar was inspired by carefully collected specimens of Urdu calligraphy and lettering which were closely studied to achieve an accurate representation of the Urdu flavour of the Nasta’liq style. Once the Nasta’liq design was firmly established, a proposal was made for a Latin counterpart that took inspiration from two eminent humanistic references: the versatile and sturdy proportions of Robert Granjon’s types, coupled with the sharp and distinctive feel of Hendrik van den Keere’s work. The Latin letterforms thus feature some subtle references to their calligraphic roots and echo the contrast present in the Nasta’liq, while remaining embedded in their classical typographic proportions. Gulzar is not the first OpenType Nasta’liq typeface, but it is the first Nasta’liq type for which an original Latin counterpart was designed. It covers all the required transliterations characters to transcribe Arabic, Persian and Urdu languages. You can read more about the inspiration, design, and engineering of Gulzar at gulzarfont.org .

      "description": "Hahmlet is inspired by a poster for the Korean ‘Hamlet’ movie from the 1940’s, created by an unknown letterer. The distinct and sharp, quirky and attention seeking details inspired Minjoo Ham to use it for a rather uncommon revival project and turn it into a robust, contemporary typeface. Once the Hangeul was finished, Mark Frömberg took on the challenge to translate the characteristics to the Latin design. A lively exploration into the possible and impossible began. Hahmlet is great for any kind of typesetting, print or screen but also a perfect eyecatcher for signage and poster designs. We highly recommend to use it for Hangeul and Latin bilingual typography.

Each glyph is stationed at a different position in respect to the baseline, and ascenders and descenders vary, which all contribute to the human-like qualities of the font. Handlee is a great font for any web page looking to add some personality and charisma. There was careful attention to detail in removing unnecessary overlap between letters, which allows Handlee to be scaled down to very small sizes while still maintaining legibility. The diaritics were purposefully designed at a slightly larger scale than normal to add to the ability to be scaled down. Also, the accents on the accented characters were not automatically generated but were rather hand placed individually to portray asymmetry and inconsistency that is typically found in handwriting. All of the little details and careful considerations in Handlee make it the perfect font for any project.",

Harmattan Version 2.000 (released in June 2020) now includes a Bold style and contains near complete coverage of all the characters defined in Unicode 13.0 for Arabic script (excluding the Arabic Presentation Forms blocks, which are not recommended for normal use). It has full support for the Arabic and Arabic Supplement Unicode blocks, and the Arabic Extended-A block with the exception of U+08D3..U+08E2. In 2023 an additional two weights for this typeface family were added for a total of four weights now. The glyphset was expanded to support all of the Unicode 15.0 character set. Support for the Kyrgyz language was added. Bob Hallissy does Graphite, OpenType, and TypeTuner code, and build support. Becca Hirsbrunner is the Lead Designer. George W.

      "description": "The Charles Bluemlein Script Collection is an intriguing reminder of the heady days of hand lettering and calligraphy in the United States. From the early 1930s through World War II, there were about 200 professional hand letterers working in New York City alone. This occupation saw its demise with the advent of photo lettering, and after digital typography it became virtually extinct. The odd way in which the Bluemlein scripts were assembled and created - by collecting different signatures and then building complete alphabets from them - is a fascinating calligraphic adventure. Because the set of constructed designs looked nothing like the original signatures, fictitious names were assigned to the new script typefaces. The typeface styles were then showcased in Higgins Ink catalogs. Alejandro Paul and Sudtipos bring the Bluemlein scripts back to life in a set of expanded digital versions, reflecting the demands of today’s designer. Extreme care has been taken to render the original scripts authentically, keeping the fictitious names originally assigned to them by Bluemlein.",

Hind’s letterforms have a humanist-style construction, which is paired with seemingly monolinear strokes. Most of these strokes have flat endings: they either terminate with a horizontal or a vertical shear, rather than on a diagonal. This helps create clear-cut counter forms between the characters. In addition to this, Hind’s letterforms feature open apertures. The entire typeface family feels very legible when used to set text. The Devanagari and Latin script components are scaled in relation to each other so that the Devanagari headline falls just below the Latin capital-height. In other words, the Devanagari base characters are 94% as tall as the Latin uppercase. Text set in the Devanagari script sits nicely alongside the Latin lowercase, too. Hind’s Devanagari vowel marks take forms that tends toward the traditional end of the design spectrum, while the knotted terminals inside of the base characters feature a treatment that appears more contemporary. Each font in the Hind family has 1146 glyphs, which include hundreds of unique Devanagari conjuncts. These ensure full support for the major languages written with the Devanagari script. The Latin component’s character set is a basic western one, which enables typesetting in English and the other Western European languages. Hind is a solid choice for UI design, and a wise selection for electronic display embedding. Manushi Parikh designed Hind for the Indian Type Foundry, who first published the fonts in 2014.

      "description": "Hind Vadodara is a family of five Gujarati fonts, which are part of the Indian Type Foundry’s larger Open Source Hind Multi-Script project. Hind Multi-Script is a type system providing nine stylistically-matching font families – one for each of the following writing systems used in Bangladesh, India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka: Bengali, Devanagari, Gujarati, Gurmukhi, Kannada, Malayalam, Tamil, Telugu, and Sinhala. In addition to Gujarati, the Hind Vadodara fonts also include Latin-script characters. Developed explicitly for use in User Interface design, Hind’s letterforms have a humanist-style construction, paired with seemingly monolinear strokes. Most of these strokes have flat endings: they either terminate with a horizontal or a vertical shear, rather than on a diagonal. This helps create clear-cut counter forms between the characters. Additionally, Hind’s letterforms feature open apertures and counterforms. The entire family feels very legible when used to set text. The Gujarati and Latin script components are scaled in relation to each other so that the height of the Gujarati base characters is more or less at the same visual height that the Latin capital letters share. The exact height of the Gujarati characters increases vis à vis the capital height as the family increases in weight, just as the Latin lowercase does. Each font in the Hind Vadodara family has 851 glyphs, which include many unique Gujarati conjuncts. These ensure full support for the writing of the Gujarati language. The Latin component’s character set is Adobe Latin 3, which enables typesetting in English and the other Western European languages. Hind Vadodara is a solid alternate when choosing typefaces for UI design, and a wise selection for electronic display embedding. Hitesh Malaviya designed Hind Vadodara for ITF, who first published the fonts in 2015. Hind Vadodara is named after Vadodara, a city in Gujarat, India. The Hind Vadodara project is led by Indian Type Foundry, a type design foundry based in Ahmedabad, India. To contribute, see github.com/itfoundry/hind-vadodara",

Iceland is a modular square-shaped webfont by Victor Kharyk with a cold brutal character designed with the intention to perform well on screen starting from low resolutions. For this purpose the strokes are deliberatly kept vertical and diagonal cuts have a 45° angle, outlines are rounded. Features like wide proportions and generous x-height are introduced for better legibility. Unconventional and simplified letterforms like k, f, r aid readability at small sizes. While at display sizes they add a crisp and sharp impression. Uppercase letters are decently heavier compared to lowercase as a tribute to the old typographic tradition. This way uppercase is easily distinguished from lowercase, and allows scaling down to be used as Small Caps. Because of its ascetic modular character and squarish proportions Iceland webfont is easily integrated in modular grids and logotypes.",

Since 1668 he spent his life creating a ‘learned press’ in Oxford, endowed with invaluable equipment, setting a high standard for the future of his publishing. He wrote: &quot;The foundation of all successe must be layd in doing things well, and I am sure that will not be don with English letters&quot; (to Jenkins, 2 Dec. 1672). So he collectected types available in the foreign market: mainly France, Holland and Germany. Fell decided to develop types in its own ‘workhouse’ too. Peter De Walpergen became his personal type-founder. Says Harry Carter in “THE FELL TYPES. What has been done in and about them” (Oxford University Press, New York, 1968): &quot;He was born at Frankfurt am Main, descended from a Protestant refugee from Antwerp. He was engaged by the Dutch East India Company in 1671 to work as a type-founder and printer in Java. The comparative crudity of his letter design makes it seems unlikely that he had been trained to cut punches.&quot; John Fell entrusted him with the cut of the larger bodies: Great Primer Roman and Italic; Double Pica Roman and Italic; French Canon Roman and Italic; Three Lines Pica Roman. De Walpergen cut other types and letters for existing types to be harmonized with the larger bodies. Commented Morison: &quot;The design of these large Fell Types is difficult to characterize and impossible wholly to approve. It has some affinity with the Dutch work of the second half of the seventeenth century, especially with the bigger size of type shown in the Widow Elsevier’s specimen-sheet of types attributed to Christoffel van Dyck; but De Walpergen went much further in the contrasting weight of thick and thin strokes and his design has crudities about it of which Van Dyck would not have been capable.&quot; In 1686 John Fell died. In his “will” he bequeathed the entire collection of type to the University of Oxford. Remembers Morison: &quot;This entire collection of ‘founding Materialls of Punchions Matrices Moulds’ was ‘got together’ by John Fell ‘and others at great expense’. Fell’s instructions that they ‘be carefully kept together’ by his executors were duly observed. The Chancellor, Masters, and Scholars of the University of Oxford honourably played their part in sustaining the interests of ‘learning and printing’ and thus the collection was not dissipated but manteined entire.&quot;",

Remembers Morison: &quot;This entire collection of ‘founding Materialls of Punchions Matrices Moulds’ was ‘got together’ by John Fell ‘and others at great expense’. Fell’s instructions that they ‘be carefully kept together’ by his executors were duly observed. The Chancellor, Masters, and Scholars of the University of Oxford honourably played their part in sustaining the interests of ‘learning and printing’ and thus the collection was not dissipated but manteined entire.&quot;",

There are a great many &#8220;programmer fonts,&#8221; designed primarily for use on the screen, but in most cases do not have the attention to detail for high resolution rendering. Inconsolata draws from many inspirations and sources. I was particularly struck by the beauty of Luc(as) de Groot's Consolas, which is his monospaced design for Microsoft's Vista release. This font, similar to his earlier TheSansMono, demonstrated clearly to me that monospaced fonts do not have to suck. The development of the Regular style by Raph Levien was started in 2006 using his own Spiro-based tools and FontForge. The Bold style was designed by Kirill Tkachev and the Cyreal foundry in 2012. Updated September 2015: Internal metadata corrected. Updated April 2020: Family has been upgraded to a variable font family. To contribute, see github.com/googlefonts/inconsolata .",

It comes with a complement of typographical sorts and OpenType features for the purpose. The proportions of Inknut Antiqua make it well suited for low-resolution screens. The Inknut (Terminalia Chebula), called »harad« in Hindi, is a nut-like fruit that can be used for ink making and is purported to cure blindness.

At first some basic letters were based on specially modified METAFONT sources from the CM Bright font family from the TeX community. (METAFONT is very flexible technology.) But in fact Istok fonts are now very far from this origin. Contours of the font are designed in the freely distributable font editor, FontForge . Most glyphs are manually hinted with the aim to be rendered on LCD displays. I used xgridfit as a tool for programming truetype instructions. Less frequently utilized symbols have automatic instructions produced by FontForge autohinting, until manual hinting can be done. Manual and automatic instructions are intended to look homogeneous. The original sources and truetype fonts are available at code.google.com/p/istok and this 'Web' version has modified vertical metrics. Updated: June 2014 to version 1.0.2g",

The Soft Type is a collection of typefaces designed for knitting color-work. Designing typefaces for knitting is essentially the same as creating pixel types.

Scale is determined by the weight of the yarn as well as the number of pixels that make up the height of each letter. In this collection, the number following the typeface's name indicates the height of the capital letters for that typeface. These typefaces were designed with machine knitting in mind, but could be used for hand knitting, needlework, bedazzling, or many other textile crafts. Note: For Fair Isle knitting, you need to beware of floats and plan accordingly, as always.

      "description": "Jaini and Jaini Purva (both Devanagari) are typefaces based on the calligraphic style of the Jain Kalpasutra manuscripts, particularly referencing a manuscript from 1503 CE. The manuscript style has several unique features not seen in the commonly observed Balbodh style. These include a disconnected shirorekha with triangular wedges, short upper matras, squarish letters with large kana height, heavy knots, and the integration of lower matras within the kana height. It also contains some letter-shapes that have evolved over time and are not familiar to current readers. In an attempt to revive the distinct calligraphic style for contemporary use, Jaini adapts visual features of the manuscript style to contemporary letter-structures. Jaini and Jaini Purva differ in their treatment of conjuncts; Jaini adheres to contemporary conventions of horizontal conjuncts, whereas Jaini Purva stays true to vertically stacked conjuncts as seen in manuscripts. While Jaini Devanagari references past manuscripts, its Latin companion draws inspiration from a hand-lettering style seen in present-day India. In regions where Devanagari is predominantly used, it is not uncommon to see Latin letterforms drawn with a Devanagari pen angle (which is almost perpendicular to the Latin pen angle) with a subtle hint of a shirorekha. Jaini (Latin) draws inspiration from this street style while visually matching it with the wavy stems and squarish counters of Jaini Devanagari. Jaini Devanagari was designed in 2016 by Girish Dalvi and Maithili Shingre. Jaini Latin was designed in 2023 by Taresh Vohra. This project is led by Ek Type, a collective of type designers based in Mumbai focused on designing contemporary Indian typefaces. To contribute to the project, see github.com/EkType/Jaini",

While Jaini Devanagari references past manuscripts, its Latin companion draws inspiration from a hand-lettering style seen in present-day India. In regions where Devanagari is predominantly used, it is not uncommon to see Latin letterforms drawn with a Devanagari pen angle (which is almost perpendicular to the Latin pen angle) with a subtle hint of a shirorekha. Jaini (Latin) draws inspiration from this street style while visually matching it with the wavy stems and squarish counters of Jaini Devanagari. Jaini Devanagari was designed in 2016 by Girish Dalvi and Maithili Shingre. Jaini Latin was designed in 2023 by Taresh Vohra. This project is led by Ek Type, a collective of type designers based in Mumbai focused on designing contemporary Indian typefaces. To contribute to the project, see github.com/EkType/Jaini",

Designed by Nicolas Silva and Pablo Cosgaya, Jaldi is developed to match with the Latin design of the Asap family , named after the acronym \"As Soon As Possible.\" This family is specially developed for screen reading and use as a webfont, and like Asap is has a special twist: Jaldi offers a standardised character width on all styles, which means that lines of text always remain the same length. This useful feature allows users to change type styles on-the-go without reflowing text bodies. Asap is based on Ancha, designed by Pablo Cosgaya and Hector Gatti in collaboration with Andres Torresi. This project is led by Omnibus Type, a type foundry based in Argentina.

      "description": "Jomhuria is a dark Persian/Arabic and Latin display typeface, suitable for headline and other display usage. The name means 'republic,' and the spark of inspiration for the design was a stencil of “Shablon” showing just a limited character set just for the Persian language without any marks, vowels or Latin glyphs. Shablon was designed 30 years ago in Iran, and is reinterpreted by Kourosh to incorporate contemporary techniques, aesthetics and of course some personal taste. While inspired by the spirit of Shablon, Jomhuria is a new typeface that stands on its own. The typeface designer Kourosh created an additional original Latin design that is tailored to harmonize with the aesthetics of the Persian/Arabic design. Being made for big sizes means details matter. The positions of the dots remains faithful to their locations in Persian/Arabic calligraphy; this is an important factor of beauty in the writing system and is key to readability. The Arabic script was designed by Kourosh Beigpour, and the Latin was designed by Eben Sorkin. The font is engineered by Lasse Fister, and the technicalities build upon those developed by Khaled Hosny for his “Amiri.” The Latin is scaled to work best with the Arabic component. The Jomhuria project is led by KB Studio, a type design foundry based in Los Angelese, USA. To contribute, see github.com/Tarobish/Jomhuria",

Following the 1930s trend for geometric typefaces, it just came to me that something between Kabel and Memphis with modern details will look great. I wanted to stick to the idea of Scandinavian style, so I put a lot of attention to the diacritics, especially to \"æ\" which has loops connecting in a continuous way, so the \"e\" slope was determined by this character. It also has some typewriter style attributes, because I've liked the Letter Gothic typeface since I was in high school, and that's why I decided to make a Slab version of Josefin Sans.",

This lends itself particularly well to animations. Each glyph has four primary states that be morphed between, and can be considered the most stable and considered forms. Each of these are accessible as instances (styles) in font menus that properly support variable fonts. This offers a quick alternative for accessing the alternate forms, and can be handy if you don’t need all the variety, and in-between states of the full variable font.

      "description": "Kadwa is a Devanagari typeface family designed by Sol Matas. It is based on the original Latin typeface Bitter , a slab serif typeface for text. People read and interact with text on screens more and more each day. What happens on screen ends up being more important than what comes out of the printer. With the accelerating popularity of electronic books, type designers are working hard to seek out the ideal designs for reading on screen. Motivated by Sol's love for the pixel she designed Bitter, and later Kadwa. A \"contemporary\" slab serif typeface for text, it is specially designed for comfortably reading on any computer or device. The robust design started from the austerity of the pixel grid, based on rational rather than emotional principles. It combines the large x-heights and legibility of the humanistic tradition with subtle characteristics in the characters that inject a certain rhythm to flowing texts. It has little variation in stroke weight and the Regular is darker than a typical typeface intended for use in print. This generates an intense color in paragraphs, accentuated by the serifs that are as thick as strokes, with square terminals. Each glyph is carefully designed with an excellent curve quality added to the first stage of the design, that was entirely made in a pixel grid. The typeface is balanced and manually spaced to use very few kerning pairs, especially important for web font use since most browsers do not currently support this feature. The Kadwa project is led by Sol Matas, a type designer based in Berlin, Germany. To contribute, see github.com/solmatas/Kadwa",

      "description": "Kalam is a handwriting-style typeface supporting the Devanagari and Latin scripts. This is an Open Source font family first published by the Indian Type Foundry in 2014. Even though Kalam's letterforms derive from handwriting, the fonts have each been optimised for text on screen. All in all, the typeface is a design that feels very personal. Like many informal handwriting-style fonts, it appears rather fresh and new when seen on screen or printed on the page. Kalam's letterforms feature a very steep slant from the top right to the bottom left. They are similar to letters used in everyday handwriting, and look like they might have been written with either a thin felt-tip pen, or a ball-point pen. In the Devanagari letterforms, the knotted-terminals are open, but some other counter forms are closed. Features like these strengthen the feeling that text set in this typeface has been written very quickly, in a rapid manner. Kalam is available in three weights: Light, Regular and Bold. Each font contains 1,025 glyphs, which includes many unique Devanagari conjuncts. These ensure full support for the major languages written with the Devanagari script. The Latin component's character set is a basic western one, which enables typesetting in English and the other Western European languages. Lipi Raval and Jonny Pinhorn developed the family for ITF; Raval designed the Devanagari component while she and Pinhorn worked together on the Latin. The Kalam project is led by Indian Type Foundry, a type design foundry based in Ahmedabad, India. To contribute, see github.com/itfoundry/kalam Updated July 2015: Updated to v2.001 with improved OpenType features.",

      "description": "Kanit means mathematics in Thai, and the Kanit typeface family is a formal Loopless Thai and Sans Latin design. It is a combination of concepts, mixing a Humanist Sans Serif motif with the curves of Capsulated Geometric styles that makes it suitable for various uses, contemporary and futuristic. A notable detail is that the stroke terminals have flat angles, which allows the design to enjoy decreased spacing between letters while preserving readability and legibility at smaller point sizes. In Thai typeface design the formal loopless Thai typefaces have more simple forms than the conservative looped Thai designs, and this simplification has to be done properly in order to preserve the essential character of each letter. Sizes and positions of vowels and tone marks need to be managed carefully because they are all relevant to readability, legibility, and overall textures. When designing Kanit, special care was taken with some groups of letters such as ก ถ ภ ฤ ฦ, ฎ ฏ, บ ป, and ข ช to ensure they are distinct and legible, because it might lead to confusion if each glyph is not clear enough. Kanit is the first Thai font family to be hinted with TTFAutohint , an easy-to-use hinting tool that is highly recommended. The Kanit project is led by Cadson Demak, a type foundry in Thailand.

Because of that, Kaushan Script is unrefined - and carries a lot of energy. By avoiding typographical perfection, it stays more natural. The angles of the vertical strokes vary a little, and the positioning along the baseline jumps around, giving it a more rustic and natural feeling. Most script fonts have long ascenders and descenders, and this means they look too small when used at normal sizes on the web. This font is optimized in such details to be very readable as a web font, even when used as small as 16 px. It was funded by people like you, via Kickstarter. Special thanks to the project backers!

      "description": "Kavivanar is a unique handwriting font that supports the Tamil and Latin scripts. It is somewhat bold, and slightly slanted, a typical Tamil handwriting style where an incline is popular. The letterforms show a calligraphic pen stress that brings an aliveliness to the letters, and provides texture in body text settings. It works well with both body text and display text because of the intriguing rhythm. The slanted letterforms for Tamil are inspired from a manuscript by Kavivanar M. A. Azeez (1948-2002), a Tamil poet and educator who lived in the east coast of Sri Lanka. The Kavivanar project is led by Tharique Azeez, a type designer based in Sri Lanka.

      "description": "Khand is a family of compact mono-linear fonts with very open counter forms. Developed for display typography, the family is primarily intended for headline usage. Its letterforms are dynamic, and everything is designed according to a modular system. All of its shapes bear a strong commonality to one another, but the typeface strikes a good balancing act and avoids too much repetitiveness. The lighter styles are suitable for short paragraphs of running text, while the heavier styles have been optimized for headlines or single word settings. The base character height in the Khand fonts is ‘big on the body.’ Across a line of text, the consonantal forms take up the majority of vertical space. Vowel marks above and below have been shortened – keeping these to a minimum allows for lines of text to be set more closely together vertically. The reduction of interlinear space is paramount for successful headline typesetting, and Khand performs much better in display applications than similar fonts with more elongated vowel marks. Because of their reduced height, the typeface’s vowel mark forms have been simplified somewhat out of necessity, but this stylistic reduction is in-keeping with the modular feeling of the typeface’s overall design. Dot-shaped marks appear rounded in order to help maintain their differentiation from other marks. Khand’s Devanagari component was designed by Sanchit Sawaria and Jyotish Sonowal. The Latin component was designed by Satya Rajpurohit. To contribute, see github.com/itfoundry/khand",

Kiwi Maru Regular is a typeface for visualization and sharing of everyday and slang expressions in the digital age. Nowadays, in 2020, Mincho and Gothic typefaces are exclusively used in smart phones, tablets and PC environment. We hope that the introduction of a round font will change the way people express their emotions and feelings, which have been missing from the analog and digital worlds, and the painful feeling of having too many Chinese characters in a font. There are three weights, L, R and M.

      "description": "Kumar is a series of matching Open Source display fonts. They each support the Gujarati and Latin scripts. The two Kumar fonts may be used together, or entirely on their own. Kumar One Outline is a vertical-contrast design, in which both the downstrokes as well as the left and right-hand sides of each letterform are built up out of two parallel lines and the whites space in-between them. The upstrokes and typeface’s horizontals are just thin, single lines. Kumar One itself fills in all of the thicker empty spaces in the downstrokes/horizontals, offering letterforms that are very dark and full of contrast. The Kumar design is made entirely out of straight lines; all elements that would usually be drawn with soft curves are faceted, built up out of several shorter straightened-out elements. Text in either Kumar font shimmers like a jewel; the effect of both fonts is quite decorative. The Gujarati and Latin script components are scaled in relation to each other so that the Gujarati base characters are 85% as tall as the Latin uppercase. Text set in the Gujarati script sits nicely alongside the Latin lowercase, too. Kumar’s Gujarati vowel marks are all single-line, rather than double-line. Indeed, Kumar’s Gujarati is a very unique design; there are simply no other options like it currently available! Each of the Kumar fonts has 870 glyphs, including hundreds of unique Gujarati conjuncts. The Latin component’s character set is an extended one, which enables typesetting in English and the other Western, Central, and Eastern European languages. Parimal Parmar designed Kumar for Indian Type Foundry in 2016. The Kumar project is led by Indian Type Foundry, a type design foundry based in Ahmedabad, India.

The height is between the Latin x-height and capital height. The strokes thickness is a little lighter than in the Latin; in text blocks, texts set in each script will have similar color. Hitesh Malaviya designed the Devanagari, and the Latin is by Jonny Pinhorn. To contribute, see github.com/itfoundry/laila",

      "description": "Lalezar is an Arabic and Latin display typeface for popular culture. During the 1960s and 1970s a genre of filmmaking emerged in Iran which was commonly known as Film-Farsi. The main focus of the films produced in this period was on popular subjects such as romances, musicals and unrealistic heroic characters. The movie posters designed to represent these films were also intended to exaggerate these elements by the use of provocative imagery and a particular type of display lettering. These bold and dynamic letterforms were so popular and widely used that perhaps one can consider them the most significant component of film posters in that period. Lalezar is an attempt to revive the appealing qualities in this genre of lettering and transform them into a modern Arabic display typeface and a suitable Latin companion. Although the main inspiration comes from a style of lettering that was used to represent the Persian language, here the objective is to design a typeface that can be used for most of the languages that use the Arabic script for their written communication. The Lalezar project is led by Borna Izadpanah, a type designer based in London, UK. To contribute, see github.com/BornaIz/Lalezar",

Originally conceived as part of a corporate identity for a large client, the family became available for a public release when they decided to go in different stylistic direction. Łukasz tried to carefully balance some potentially conflicting priorities in the design; to create a typeface that seems “transparent” when used in body text but also displays original traits in larger size use. Classical proportions, particularly in the uppercase, give the letterforms familiar harmony and elegance, and combine with a sleek treatement that feels contemporary without being trendy. Semi-rounded details feel warm, while the underlying structure provides stability and seriousness. “Serious but friendly, with the feeling of the Summer,” said Łukasz. Learn more at latofonts.com",

The typeface has been initially designed at ISIA Urbino by the students Luna Castroni, Stefano Faoro, Emilio Macchia, Elena Papassissa, Michela Povoleri, Tobias Seemiller, and the teacher Luciano Perondi (aka galacticus ineffabilis). This typeface has been designed in 8 hours, and was inspired by some of the typefaces used on the Olivetti typewriters. The glyphs are 'trispaced.' It means that the space are modular, 250, 500, 750, this allow a better spacing between characters, but allow also a vertical alignment similar to the one possible with a monospaced font. We were thinking it was a bright new idea, but we discovered that was usual for Olivetti typewriters working with 'Margherita.' Find out more at lektongroups.blogspot.co.uk . Updated in November 2012: As one of the earlier families published in Google Web Fonts, Lekton lacked proper subsetting, so this update introduces a default 'latin' subset that contains less characters but loads faster. To use the full character set, update your API link to include the latin-ext subset .",

      "description": "Lemon is a display typeface with soft and fluid shapes that come from painted street shop signage. The dark weight is ideal for headlines and short texts, and a future release of a lighter weight could be useful for longer text. The uppercase letters are very carefully drawn, making an attractive and unique design for text in all caps, compound words in capital letters, and acronyms. The same dynamic is inherent in the lowercase and numbers! The March 2023 update features a bigger glyphset, fractions and some minor aesthetic modifications.

It started with the Latin design Lemon , which Eduardo Tunni expanded to four weights. The Arabic was designed by Mohamed Gaber. The Arabic design is contemporary, starting with Naskh and introducing influences of Diwani. It has wide and open counters that improve readability at smaller text sizes, while its more subtle details make it a great display face at larger sizes. Lemonada is currently available as a variable font with a weight axis, four static fonts (Light, Regular, SemiBold, Bold), and a wide character set that supports the Arabic, Farsi, and Urdu languages. The Lemonada project is led by Mohamed Gaber, a type designer based in Cairo, Egypt. To contribute, see github.com/Gue3bara/Lemonada",

      "description": "Lexend fonts are intended to reduce visual stress and so improve reading performance. Initially they were designed with dyslexia and struggling readers in mind, but Bonnie Shaver-Troup, creator of the Lexend project, soon found out that these fonts are also great for everyone else. The first set of Lexend fonts by Thomas Jockin ( Deca , Exa , Giga , Mega , Peta , Tera , Zetta ) becomes wider and more openly spaced (also known as \"tracked out\"). This new version of Lexend is a variable font with a weight axis. Please note that the initial release of this font had a lighter Regular weight. It has been decided for the update of July 2021 to align the Regular weight with the one of Lexend Deca which is slightly bolder. Lexend and Lexend Deca are therefore the same (for now…). Ultimately this version will offer a HyperExpansion axis which will allow variation of inner and outer space of letterforms. True to Bonnie’s vision, Lexend fonts are freely available for all since 2019 in Google Fonts. To contribute, see github.com/googlefonts/lexend . For more information, see lexend.com . To learn more, read Clean and clear: making reading easier with Lexend (English), Partnering to change how the world reads (English), and Eine Partnerschaft mit dem Ziel, das Leseerlebnis weltweit zu verändern (Germany).",

U+0100-017F for 0..127 values with step 1. The axis range values are compatible with Wavefont by the same author, so the families can be used together with visual coherency.

Originally created as the brand typeface for Google Play Books, it exceeds the strict needs of a comfortable reading experience on any device, screen resolution, or font size. The family has matured into a full-fledged digital publishing toolbox — headline, paragraph, and caption text. Type Together redesigned it from the ground up as a variable font. Its tiny file size and infinite adjustability make it perfect for developers, mobile apps, and every screen imaginable. It’s the “every-device font”. Get the entire type family for FREE! Literata was designed by TypeTogether: Veronika Burian & José Scaglione (Latin), Irene Vlachou (Greek), Vera Evstafieva (Cyrillic) and Elena Novoselova (Cyrillic). The family won the GOLD Indigo Awards in 2021 and is the Modern Cyrillic 2021 winner. Two versions of the family exist, one for print and the other for Ebooks.

Maitree offers 6 weights, and its asymmetrically curved terminals are well-suited for both formal and casual usage, especially for works that require an antique and historical manner. A similarity between some glyphs such as ก ถ ภ ฤ ฦ, ฎ ฏ, บ ป, or ข ช is something to take into consideration because it might lead to confusion when typesetting very short texts. Sizes and positions of Thai vowels and tone marks have been managed carefully, because they are all relevant to readability, legibility, and overall texture.

It is technically optimized for better performance on screen, while carefully adjusted outlines promise good quality in print too.",

Ascenders and descenders are elegant and details refined. The name and overall feel refers to marmalade sweets - soft and ductile. All vertical strokes are rounded towards the baseline, which is why technically there is no sense for overshoots in rounded letters like O. Marmelad performs well on screen because of its soft rounded features and generous x-height. The font supports Latin and Cyrillic. In 2022, the kerning is improved and the Latin language coverage expanded. To contribute, see github.com/cyrealtype/Marmelad-Cyrillic .",

Its high-contrast strokes have a diagonal axis, in keeping with the pen-angle most often used for the Devanagari writing system. The Martel project is led by Dan Reynolds, a type designer in Berlin.

Merriweather Sans is traditional in feeling despite the modern shapes it has adopted for screens. Merriweather Sans is an evolving project and will be updated. As of now there are 8 styles: Light, Regular, Bold, and ExtraBold weights in Roman and Italic styles. There is also Merriweather , a serif version which closely harmonizes with the weights and styles of this sans-serif family. Designed by Eben Sorkin, Merriweather Sans features a large x height, slightly condensed letterforms, a mild diagonal stress and open forms. Merriweather Sans is a work in progress and will be improved regularly. This means you can request improvements and even fund specific features if if they are outside of the current scope of work. For more information and to stay updated see Eben Sorkin's blog and Flickr stream , and the MerriweatherFnt Twitter microblog. Updated in June 2013 with italic styles. Updated in January 2016: This revision improves on-screen rendering especially at text sizes with ttfautohint hinting. Merriweather Sans will work better when installed on desktops. Some OpenType features were added and improved. Since the vertical and horizontal metrics changed, this may cause some text to reflow in some browsers. A second update (v1.006) was made on 1/25 to fix ligatures and other digraphs. To contribute, see github.com/SorkinType/Merriweather-Sans .",

But please do not consider using it for longer texts, especially not for scientific texts. Miama is a very small typeface compared to other fonts. This is due to the very large ascenders and descenders. So if you want to look Miama as a font of 10pt, choose 15-20pt.

From the early 1930s through World War II, there were about 200 professional hand letterers working in New York City alone. This occupation saw its demise with the advent of photo lettering, and after digital typography it became virtually extinct. The odd way in which the Bluemlein scripts were assembled and created - by collecting different signatures and then building complete alphabets from them - is a fascinating calligraphic adventure. Because the set of constructed designs looked nothing like the original signatures, fictitious names were assigned to the new script typefaces. The typeface styles were then showcased in Higgins Ink catalogs. Alejandro Paul and Sudtipos bring the Bluemlein scripts back to life in a set of expanded digital versions, reflecting the demands of today’s designer. Extreme care has been taken to render the original scripts authentically, keeping the fictitious names originally assigned to them by Bluemlein.",

Mitr is a sans serif Latin and loopless Thai typeface that combines senses of organic and humanist sans serif designs with rounded terminals. It has a wide structure and airy negative space that preserves legibility and readability. Mitr is a novel and friendly typeface that is suitable for casual usage such as celebration cards, magazines, and posters. A similarity between some glyphs such as ก ถ ภ ฤ ฦ, ฎ ฏ, บ ป, or ข ช is something to take into consideration because it might lead to confusion when typesetting very short texts. Mitr has a specific approach to the thick and thin strokes of Thai glyphs. Other type designers may consider this font as an example when developing new fonts. Informal looped Thai typefaces have slightly simplified details, as compared to formal ones, and this allows type designers to extend them to heavier weights. The size and position of Thai vowel and tone marks have been managed carefully because they are all relevant to readability, legibility, and overall texture. The Mitr project is led by Cadson Demak, a type foundry in Thailand. To contribute, see github.com/cadsondemak/mitr",

      "description": "Modak is a sweet plump Devanagari+Latin display typeface with portly curves and thin counters. It is Unicode compliant and is open sourced under the SIL Open Font License v1.1. Modak began as a heavy hand-sketched letterform exploration in Devanagari with cute, adorable characters whose curves merged into each other, forming distinct counter shapes. As we translated these into a functional font, each character was fine-tuned and multiple matras designed to match precisely with every character. Unlike the conventional approach the post-base matras in Modak overlap the consonants. Likewise overlapping ukars were also designed leaving thin counters in between. Rather than being a mere composite of 2 separate glyphs, every conjunct was redrawn as a single entity. The challenge was to maintain legibility and consistency in the thin white counter spaces across all characters irrespective of their structural complexity. The resulting typeface is one of its kind and most likely the chubbiest Devanagari typeface to be designed so far. Modak Devanagari is designed by Sarang Kulkarni and Maithili Shingre and Modak Latin by Noopur Datye with support from Girish Dalvi. We are immensely thankful to Santosh Kshirsagar, Pradnya Naik and Yashodeep Gholap for their suggestions and feedback during the font design process. We are also grateful to our friends from the Industrial Design Centre, IIT Bombay and Sir J J Institute of Applied Art for their support and encouragement.

From the early 1930s through World War II, there were about 200 professional hand letterers working in New York City alone. This occupation saw its demise with the advent of photo lettering, and after digital typography it became virtually extinct. The odd way in which the Bluemlein scripts were assembled and created - by collecting different signatures and then building complete alphabets from them - is a fascinating calligraphic adventure. Because the set of constructed designs looked nothing like the original signatures, fictitious names were assigned to the new script typefaces. The typeface styles were then showcased in Higgins Ink catalogs. Alejandro Paul and Sudtipos bring the Bluemlein scripts back to life in a set of expanded digital versions, reflecting the demands of today’s designer. Extreme care has been taken to render the original scripts authentically, keeping the fictitious names originally assigned to them by Bluemlein.",

In fall, Julieta Ulanovsky, Sol Matas, and Juan Pablo del Peral, led the development of Cyrillic support, with consultation with Carolina Giovagnoli, Maria Doreuli, and Alexei Vanyashin. The Montserrat project is led by Julieta Ulanovsky, a type designer based in Buenos Aires, Argentina. To contribute, see github.com/JulietaUla/Montserrat",

      "description": "The old posters and signs in the traditional Montserrat neighborhood of Buenos Aires inspired Julieta Ulanovsky to design this typeface and rescue the beauty of urban typography that emerged in the first half of the twentieth century. As urban development changes that place, it will never return to its original form and loses forever the designs that are so special and unique. The letters that inspired this project have work, dedication, care, color, contrast, light and life, day and night! These are the types that make the city look so beautiful. The Montserrat Project began with the idea to rescue what is in Montserrat and set it free under a libre license, the SIL Open Font License. This is the Underline family, a sister to the normal and Alternates families. This family celebrates a special style of underline that is integrated into the letterforms found in the Montserrat neighborhood. The Montserrat project is led by Julieta Ulanovsky, a type designer based in Buenos Aires, Argentina. To contribute, see github.com/JulietaUla/Montserrat",

      "description": "This project provides a libre and open font family for the Limbu script of Nepal. According to traditional histories the Limbu script was developed by King Sirijonga in the 9th Century. It then fell out of use before being reintroduced in the 18th century by Teongsi Sirijonga (1704-1741) whom many felt to be the reincarnation of the first Sirijonga. The modern Sirijonga was apparently martyred in 1741 for the sake of this script by lamas in Sikkim. The script was named 'Sirijonga' in his honour by the Limbu scholar Iman Singh Chemjong.

It has a large height, short extenders, and a compact width for better screen use, and economy of space. The family will comprise a regular, italic, and cursive, each in five weights and with smallcaps. Two italics &mdash; one will be called \"italic\", and the other \"cursive\" &mdash; are uncommon, but very useful. Ever tried emphasizing something already emphasized? Beyond that obvious example, there are other uses. Sometimes a text needs a different flavor or feel. While one roman can work for a variety of texts, the companion italics don't always. In more classical or personal documents, a stiff, sober, modern and down-to-earth italic will never work. And in many essays, some of the fancier italics look ridiculous. Who said a roman needs only one companion?",

It has a large x-height, ample proportions, big serifs and large apertures that allow the letters to be clear, even at small sizes on low resolution screens. The capitals are unusually small, allowing them to be used as substitutes for small caps. (It's recommended to add some tracking if used in this way.) One major feature is the break in the internal curves of round characters. While this break makes some interesting forms at large sizes, their true purpose is to help make the counterforms more open at small sizes by allowing straighter stems. This reasoning is famously known as W.A. Dwiggins' “M-formula.” The italics were designed to contrast with the roman styles while maintaining good legibility. The true italic forms also have big counterforms and simple curves. The fonts have been manually hinted to get the best possible rasterization in Windows. The Noticia font family project is envisioned as 18 different fonts styles, with text, condensed, display and sans variants, different weights and including italic versions, all designed and hinted to work well on computer and mobile devices screens.",

The typeface is a free spirited twisted interpetation of the clarendonesques. With an unapologetic tendency for public shouting, it is a whimsical loudmouth attention seeker! \"Oi\" is an interjection used in various languages. Its meaning varies, depending on the tone and abruptness of its use, from a simple “hi” or a call of attention to as far as a challenge to a fight. Check out the mini-website .

However, this lettertype still has at least two advantages: it can be considered a good choice for typesetting scientific papers, especially on social and humanitarian sciences, as its specific features are closely associated in people's eyes with old books they learned on; the most beautiful examples of Greek and Cyrillic lettertypes were all based on the classicist style, so for those scripts, \"Modern\" fonts are much more appropriate than any contemporary (e. g. Times-based) designs. The name \"Old Standard\" was selected as opposed to the \"Obyknovennaya Novaya\" (\"New Standard\") typeface, widely used in Soviet typography, which represents another, slightly different type of the same Modern style. Of course this name doesn't look very original, but it seems to be a good choice for a revival of the most common lettertype of the early 20th century.",

If you’ve ever seen a futuristic sci-fi movie, you may have noticed that all other fonts have been lost or destroyed in the apocalypse that led humans to flee earth. Only those very few geometric typefaces have survived to be used on spaceship exteriors, spacestation signage, monopolistic corporate branding, uniforms featuring aerodynamic shoulder pads, etc. Of course Orbitron could also be used on the posters for the movies portraying this inevitable future. It was initially published on the League of Movable Type . Orbitron was remastered as a variable font in 2019. To contribute updates or file issues, see https://github.com/theleagueof/orbitron .",

The characters of Oswald were initially re-drawn and reformed to better fit the pixel grid of standard digital screens. Oswald is designed to be used freely across the internet by web browsers on desktop computers, laptops and mobile devices. - Since the initial launch in 2011, Oswald was updated continually by Vernon Adams until 2014. Vernon added Light and Bold weights, support for more Latin and Cyrillic languages, tightened the spacing and kerning and made many glyph refinements throughout the family based on hundreds of users' feedback. - In 2016 the Latin part of the family was updated by Kalapi Gajjar to complete the work started by Vernon. - In January 2019, it was updated with a variable font Weight axis. - In July 2023, the font was upgraded with a Cyrillic character set expansion, and the rendering of math symbols was improved.

The capitals suggested the time in which they were made because of the soft serif treatment used. This detail and a subtle casual feeling creeping into the otherwise classical forms led to the soft genial lowercase and the whimsical numbers now seen in Ovo. Ovo is a medium contrast serif font. Because of the old style variable letter widths and subtle detail it will work best at medium to large sizes. Source files are available from Google Code .

Pattaya is a version of Lobster extended into Thai, and supports Latin and all variations of the Thai script with an informal loopless design. However, vertical metrics (that effect line-spacing) had to be adjusted in order to support Thai vowels and tone marks, so this is published as a separate family. A similarity between some glyphs such as ก ถ ภ ฤ ฦ, ฎ and ฏ, บ and ป, or ข and ช is something to take into consideration because it might lead to confusion when typesetting very short texts. Pattaya has a specific approach to the thick and thin strokes of Thai glyphs. Other type designers of Thai fonts may like to use this approach as a reference. Informal loopless Thai tyefaces have slightly simplified details, as compared to formal ones, and this simplification has to be done properly in order to preserve the character of each glyph. The size and position of Thai vowel and tone marks need to be managed carefully, because they are all relevant to readability, legibility, and overall texture. The Pattaya project is led by Cadson Demak, a type foundry in Thailand. To contribute, see github.com/cadsondemak/pattaya",

      "description": "Formal Scripts are great typefaces to suggest elegance, quality, refinement and luxury. They are used a lot in print publishing, but you don't see many formal scripts used on the web. Isn't it? Mostly because their tiny hairlines breaks and disappear when used at small sizes on the screen. Also, they usually have long ascenders and descenders, and the lowercase letters look too small when compared to most sans or serif fonts. More over, they are usually quite condensed, making them even more difficult to read. That's why we designed a script type specifically tailored for web use, that can survive being set even as small as 13px.",

Petrona playfully maneuvers plenty of personal touches, without losing the essence of a design intended for legibility in digital and print media, from headlines to body text. Uppercase glyphs have heavy asymmetric serifs and arms with inverted angles, which combine with lowercase designs that share a big x-height, pronounced ascenders, and soft curves of low stroke contrast. First published in Google Fonts in November 2011 as a single style Roman design, it was completely redrawn in 2019 and 2020. It has evolved, and now offers a comprehensive range of weights, a complete set of corresponding italics, and an extended glyph set that supports over 200 Latin languages. A full set of small caps, plus ligatures, alternates, and all kinds of numerals, fractions, punctuations, symbols, and currencies are included. As a variable font, it has a Weight axis in both the roman and italic files. The previous swashy Q is still available, found in Stylistic Set 1. It is now a typeface that supplies everything needed for fine text typography. The Petrona project is led by Ringo R. Seeber from Glyph Co, based in Brooklyn, NY.

As a new way to achieve variable font, the lighterPhudu gets, the extended it becomes, for people to read it easier compared to other lightweight narrow typefaces. In the progress of learning and crafting types, Duong has always thought about what makes a Vietnamese typeface. If we rewind to the past, we can see a Vietnamese lettering style on the billboard stores, when the artists adapted Latin typefaces and then added marks based on their styles. Among those, there were mostly all-caps sans-serif types played as descriptions or the store's names themself. To make a new easy-to-read and easy-to-get typeface, Duong mixed some of the researched letters from the story above. He doesn't want to just revive the types, he wants to improve them to fit the modern-day styles, but still have \"Vietnamese\" souls in them. The typeface was named Phudu (phục dựng) - \"revival\" in Vietnamese, and has a meaning of timeless (quite the opposite of the name when it can be read as \"phù du\" - ephemeral).

      "description": "Playfair is a transitional design. In the European Enlightenment in the late 18th century, broad nib quills were replaced by pointed steel pens as the popular writing tool of the day. Together with developments in printing technology, ink, and paper making, it became fashionable to print letterforms of high contrast and delicate hairlines that were increasingly detached from the written letterforms. This design lends itself to this period, and while it is not a revival of any particular design, it takes influence from the designs of John Baskerville and from ‘Scotch Roman’ designs. This typeface was initially published in 2011, and had a major update in 2017. Being a Display (large size) design in the transitional genre, functionally and stylistically it can accompany Georgia or Gelasio for body text. It was succeeded in 2023 by the complete Playfair design, which as a variable font includes body text designs in the optical size axis. This is the main family, with a sibling Playfair Display SC small caps family. The main family downloaded font files include a full set of small caps, common ligatures, and discretionary ligatures. The Playfair project is led by Claus Eggers Sørensen, a type designer based in Amsterdam, Netherlands. To contribute, see github.com/clauseggers/Playfair-Display",

      "description": "Playfair is a transitional design. In the European Enlightenment in the late 18th century, broad nib quills were replaced by pointed steel pens as the popular writing tool of the day. Together with developments in printing technology, ink, and paper making, it became fashionable to print letterforms of high contrast and delicate hairlines that were increasingly detached from the written letterforms. This design lends itself to this period, and while it is not a revival of any particular design, it takes influence from the designs of John Baskerville and from ‘Scotch Roman’ designs. This typeface was initially published in 2011, and had a major update in 2017. Being a Display (large size) design in the transitional genre, functionally and stylistically it can accompany Georgia or Gelasio for body text. It was succeeded in 2023 by the complete Playfair design, which as a variable font includes body text designs in the optical size axis. This is the Small Cap sibling family to the main Playfair Display family. The main family downloaded font files include a full set of small caps, common ligatures, and discretionary ligatures.

The fonts were originally commissioned by 6616 Studio for Jakarta Provincial Government program's +Jakarta City of Collaboration identity in 2020. Taking inspiration in Neuzeit Grotesk, Futura, and 1930s grotesque sans serifs with almost monolinear contrast and pointy curves, the fonts consist of modern and clean cut forms, the x-height dimension slightly taller to provide clear spaces between caps and x-height, and also equipped with open counters and balanced spaces to preserve the legibility at a large range of sizes. The beauty of diversity captured in typography. Like the city itself, the uniqueness of this font is that in some glyphs it has its own diversity and characteristic of various explorations of forms that enrich the expressions and stories that coexist. The charms of Plus Jakarta Sans fonts appear when one looks closer, manifesting in a beauty that emerges once seen as a whole. Each alternate in the family contains several alternative characters, divided into three stylistic sets which Lancip (Sharp), Lurus (Straight), and Lingkar (Swirl). As part of +Jakarta City of Collaboration , the fonts are made available for public use under the SIL Open Font License. To contribute, see github.com/tokotype/PlusJakartaSans .",

Historical research was carried out in parallel with the preparation of the computer version, which allowed to learn about the unique story of this most recognizable Polish font design. The Półtawski Nowy type family is intended for typesetting in sizes from 10 to 18 pt. The project is implemented thanks to the support of the Digital Culture 2020 program of the Ministry of Culture and National Heritage. In the Półtawski Nowy digitisation, the source of the study were scans of a type specimen book from the Idźkowski i S-ka foundry, a set of drawings, punch patterns and punches made by Monotype in Salfords, Great Britain in 1934-1955. They were made available by the Type Archive London. Thanks to the standardization of characters and the balancing of the typographic rhythm, in the digital version, the typeface retains its ornamental character, while working well in smaller text sizes. The basic character set available in the sources has been extended with further variants of diacritics, small caps, subscript and superscript, variants of numbers (tabular, proportional, nautical) and a set of OpenType features.

Thanks to its careful balance between the x-height and glyph widths, it allows more economy and legibility than standard web serifs, even in small sizes. This font was originally designed to compose texts in agglutinative languages; these contain very long words. The goal was to develop a typeface that would tolerate cramped tracking and that would increase the number of letters on a single line. Poly is a Unicode typeface family that supports Open Type features and languages that use the Latin script and its variants, especially Native South American language families.",

      "description": "Geometric sans serif typefaces have always been popular, and with support for both the Devanagari and Latin writing systems, Poppins is an internationalist addition to the genre. Many of the Latin glyphs (such as the ampersand) are more constructed and rationalist than is typical. The Devanagari design was particularly novel when it was first published in 2015, and was the first ever Devanagari typeface with a range of weights in this genre. Just like the Latin, the Devanagari is based on pure geometry, particularly circles. Each letterform is nearly monolinear, with optical corrections applied to stroke joints where necessary to maintain an even typographic color. The Devanagari base character height and the Latin ascender height are equal; Latin capital letters are shorter than the Devanagari characters, and the Latin x-height is set rather high. The project was developed by Indian Type Foundry (ITF). The Devanagari was initially designed by Ninad Kale, while the Latin was initially designed by Jonny Pinhorn. Following their principal phase of designing the first 5 styles, the typeface was later refined, and expanded to include multiple weights and italics, by the ITF studio team.

A similarity between some glyphs such as ก ถ ภ ฤ ฦ, ฎ ฏ, บ ป, and ข ช is something to take into consideration because it might lead to confusion when typesetting very short texts. Pridi has a specific approach to the thick and thin strokes of Thai glyphs. Other type designers of Thai fonts may like to use this approach as a reference. Informal looped Thai typefaces have slightly simplified details, as compared to formal ones, and this allows designers to extend the font to heavier weights. The size and position of Thai vowel and tone marks need to be managed carefully, because they are all relevant to readability, legibility, and overall texture. The Pridi project is led by Cadson Demak, a type foundry in Thailand. To contribute, see github.com/cadsondemak/pridi",

The fonts are released with a libre license and can be freely redistributed: The main aim of the project is to give possibility to the people of Russia to read and write in their native languages. The project is dedicated to the 300 year anniversary of the civil type invented by Peter the Great in 1708–1710. It was given financial support from the Russian Federal Agency for Press and Mass Communications. The fonts include standard Western, Central European and Cyrillic code pages, plus the characters of every title language in the Russian Federation. This makes them a unique and very important tool for modern digital communications. PT Serif is a transitional serif typeface with humanistic terminals. It is designed for use together with PT Sans, and is harmonized across metrics, proportions, weights and design. The family consists of six styles: regular and bold weights with corresponding italics form a standard font family for basic text setting; two caption styles in regular and italic are for use in small point sizes. Designed by Alexandra Korolkova, Olga Umpeleva and Vladimir Yefimov and released by ParaType in 2010.",

      "description": "I started drawing letters with a computer when I first got one of my own in 1997. I’d been studying sans serif type as a project on the Typography &amp; Graphic Communication course that I was taking at Reading University, and learning about the different strands of development: ‘grotesques’ such as the delightful Monotype Series 215 were designed by type cutters or draftsmen, while geometric and humanist sans serifs like Futura and Gill Sans were constructed with compasses or quills by rationalist typographers and calligraphers. In the end, of course, they all needed a little wash and brush-up from the typefounder – to say nothing of the type designs. I was also in thrall of a typeface called Ehrhardt, a Monotype revival typeface that is based on a seventeenth century design by Miklos Kis. It too had endured a lot of cleaning, but though they were hard on the source material, those responsible created a very elegant condensed typeface. The result looks a bit like a house on an Amsterdam canal. Puritan was my response to these influences; it was also a way (I thought) that I could get hold of an interesting typeface without unofficially borrowing from the Typography department. It might be flawed, but it was mine! Well, I learned a lot from the experience. I wrote a short essay about Puritan as a project in my final year as an undergraduate. Rather than repeat it all here, I have converted the essay (presented as a booklet) into a PDF file of around 1200K which you can download. In October 1999, I submitted Puritan to the 3rd International Type Design Contest, where it made absolutely no impact.",

Maybe because the were derived from the more traditional serif typefaces of the time. But for same reason, as the genre evolved, the fashion was to create 'monoline' sans, of very little contrast. Today, contrasted Sans are very rare, and only a few are successful. While digging in old specimens, we found three that immediately caught our attention: Doric Italic and Taylor Gothic from American Type Founders (1897), and Charter Oak from Keystone Type Foundry of Philadelphia (1906).

The Radio-Canada font was created in 2017 by Montreal-based designer and typographer Charles Daoud, in collaboration with Coppers and Brasses and Alexandre Saumier Demers. It was designed specifically for CBC/Radio-Canada as a brand unifying information font for all the Public Broadcaster’s platforms. Fittingly, for a Public Broadcaster, this is a peoples’ font and the humanistic style stands out with distinctive angles and subtle curves. Its x-height ensures excellent legibility and respects digital accessibility standards, making it very effective when used in continuous text. In 2018, the Radio-Canada font won three awards, in the Font Design category at Communication Arts Typography, Applied Arts Design Annual and at Grand Prix Grafika. Several optimizations saw the light of day in 2021. The number of supported languages has increased from 106 to 317 Latin languages. In 2023, Jacques Le Bailly (Baron von Fonthausen) expanded the font to include the support of Indigenous languages. To contribute, see github.com/cbcrc/radiocanadafonts .

      "description": "Radley is based on lettering originally drawn and designed for woodcarved titling work. It was later digitized and extended to be used on the web. Radley is a practical face, based on letterforms used by hand carvers who cut letters quickly, efficiently, and with style. It can be used for both titling and text typography. The basic letterforms in Radley grew out of sketching and designing directly into wood with traditional carving chisels. These were scanned and traced into FontForge and cleaned up digitally, then the character set was expanded. There is something unique about carving letters into wood with traditional hand tools, and hopefully Radley carries some of the original spirit of these hand carved letterforms. Since the initial launch in 2012, Radley was updated by Vernon Adams adding an Italic and support for more Latin languages. He made many glyph refinements throughout the family based on user feedback. In 2017 the family was updated by Marc Foley to complete the work started by Vernon.

      "description": "Recursive is typographic palette for UI & code. It draws inspiration from single-stroke casual, a style of brush writing used in signpainting that is stylistically flexible and warmly energetic. Recursive adapts this aesthetic basis into an extensive variable font family, designed to excel in digital interactive environments, including data-rich user interfaces, technical documentation, and code editors. Recursive offers a lot more styles than you see here! To download the full Recursive Sans &amp; Mono family, learn more about its 5 variable axes, and to configure advanced Google Fonts URL embed code for access to Recursive’s full stylistic range, check out its website at: → recursive.design The Recursive project is led by Arrow Type, a type foundry based in Brooklyn, NY, USA. To contribute, see its GitHub repo . Update, April 2021: the Google Fonts release of Recursive has been updated to incorporate various changes from its initial release. This includes fixes that correct printing issues, ensure consistent default line heights between styles on macOS, improve the handling of combining accents, add localization features for several languages, and resolve various other earlier issues.",

      "description": "Rhodium Libre was designed for use on screens at small sizes and the Latin and Devanagari scripts. To that end, the design is generally uncomplicated and coarse, lacking the small details that are lost on screens; this also reduces the file size to improve latency when used as a web font. The letters are designed slightly wide, with open counters, a large x-height in the Latin glyphs, and so on. The Devanagari glyphs are the same height as the Latin capitals to allow them to stand alongside the oversized Latin lowercase. Historical models for Rhodium’s design are Fortune (AKA Volta) by Konrad Bauer and Walter Baum, and Rex by Intertype. Matthew Carter’s Verdana provided insight into designing type for small sizes and adverse reading environments. The Devanagari glyph set supports contemporary Hindi, Marathi, and Nepali. The Latin glyph set supports Adobe’s Latin-3 character set. This project is led by Dunwich Type Founders, a type foundry based in Denver, Colorado, USA, who design contemporary typeface families.

      "description": "Roboto Flex upgrades Roboto so it becomes a more powerful typeface system. With Flex, you can customize Roboto to express and finesse your text in ways never before possible. Today, people are constantly switching between devices, resizing browsers, and spreading our viewports across multiple screens. So Google commissioned Font Bureau to re-imagine Roboto to “flex” along with us, with a special emphasis on large-screen capabilities. This was achieved by amplifying the original design to an extreme range of weights, grades, widths and optical sizes. The second benefit of Roboto Flex is the designer’s ability to fitness and fine-tune their designs with parametric axes . Font Bureau first demonstrated the concept of parametric axes in Amstelvar Alpha (2017), to provide the ultimate in typographic flexibility. With early prototypes of Roboto Flex, Font Bureau demonstrated new solutions to the typographic problems that digital designers face. Demonstrations of high quality justification, better dark-mode typography and other uses of parametric axes are documented at variablefonts.typenetwork.com The needs of developers, designers, and — of course — end-user readers were prioritized and aligned during development. To make Roboto Flex production-ready for all print and digital media, Font Bureau expanded the glyph set with careful planning and development, in partnership with script experts for Cyrillic and Greek. Rigorous testing of each glyph across every axis required new type design tools to be developed, like typetools and videoproof , which can be used to explore the depth of the design. The final file size of the complete package is remarkably small, given the range of expressive styles now available. By driving variable fonts technology to its limits, it offers the most interesting and useful typographic tools for end users and designers. With a fully loaded Optical Size axis, Roboto Flex makes the layout of texts with deep hierarchies more straightforward and heightens the quality of every design that uses it. And none of this would be possible without the long list of contributors involved.

Roboto Flex is developed by Font Bureau for Google, based on the design initiated by Christian Robertson.

      "description": "Roboto Mono is a monospaced addition to the Roboto type family. Like the other members of the Roboto family, the fonts are optimized for readability on screens across a wide variety of devices and reading environments. While the monospaced version is related to its variable width cousin, it doesn&#8217;t hesitate to change forms to better fit the constraints of a monospaced environment. For example, narrow glyphs like &#8216;I&#8217;, &#8216;l&#8217; and &#8216;i&#8217; have added serifs for more even texture while wider glyphs are adjusted for weight. Curved caps like &#8216;C&#8217; and &#8216;O&#8217; take on the straighter sides from Roboto Condensed. Special consideration is given to glyphs important for reading and writing software source code. Letters with similar shapes are easy to tell apart. Digit &#8216;1&#8217;, lowercase &#8216;l&#8217; and capital &#8216;I&#8217; are easily differentiated as are zero and the letter &#8216;O&#8217;. Punctuation important for code has also been considered. For example, the curly braces &#8216;{&nbsp;}&#8217; have exaggerated points to clearly differentiate them from parenthesis &#8216;(&nbsp;)&#8217; and braces &#8216;[&nbsp;]&#8217;. Periods and commas are also exaggerated to identify them more quickly. The scale and weight of symbols commonly used as operators have also been optimized.",

Rokkitt is intended for use as a display font, in headings and headlines, though it can also be used as an alternative to sans serif designs at text sizes. Update January 2017: Vernon Adams began the project in 2011, and developed the typeface until 2014. During 2016 Kalapi Gajjar completed Vernon's original work and released a substantial update with a full set of 9 weights, and support for more Latin languages.

This Open Font License version, Ropa Sans, consists of the regular weight and the corresponding italic, and covers Latin-based languages only. While the upright styles pay a distant homage to the technical aesthetics of the early-20th century DIN series, the strongly humanistic italics breathe in quirky freshness and create a unique flavour. The step to a remarkable Italic with its extreme ink-traps caused a hard change of nearly all shapes of the first slices of Roman.",

It works especially well in delicate editorial design. Its letterpress origins mean it has a lighter color than a typical Roman text type. Its features include carefully designed serifs, gradual stroke and marked contrast, calligraphic and humanistic forms, and large ascenders and descenders. It is designed to work well in long texts with generous line spacing. It originates from work presented to the post-graduate course in Typeface Design at the University of Buenos Aires in 2011. Rosarivo is a Unicode typeface family that supports languages that use the Latin script and its variants, and could be expanded to support other scripts.

      "description": "Rozha One is a very high contrast Open Source font, which currently offers support for the Devanagari and Latin scripts. Created primarily for display use, the extreme difference between its letters’ thick and thin strokes make it an excellent choice for large headlines and poster-sized graphics. The Indian Type Foundry released Rozha One in 2014; its Devanagari character set was designed by Tim Donaldson and Jyotish Sonowal. Shiva Nallaperumal designed the Latin. The font’s Latin characters are drawn in a fat face ‘modern’ or ‘Didone’ style, similar to letters that were commonly used in 19th century advertising posters in the West. Rozha One’s Latin characters barely differentiate between upper and lowercase letter sizes; the x-height of its lowercase letters is so high – and the size of its capital letters so small – that these virtually blend into one another in a line of text. Nevertheless, the Devanagari letters are drawn in such a way that they harmonise with the font’s Latin very well in settings where texts in multiple languages sit alongside one another. The headline of the Devanagari base characters is the same thickness as the Latin letters’ serifs. Certain Devanagari letter strokes and vowel marks bare visually similarity to the font’s Latin letters. However, Rozha One does not appear Latinized or un-Devanagari. The font includes 1,095 glyphs, offering full support for the conjuncts and ligatures required by languages written with the Devanagari script. When used in on-screen design environments, Rozha One should be used in very large pixel sizes. However in print, the design may be used in a broader range of sizes, perhaps even as small as at 16 or 18 points. The Rozha project is led by Indian Type Foundry, a type design foundry based in Ahmedabad, India. To contribute, see github.com/itfoundry/rozhaone",

Avoiding any stereotypes of grunge, vernacular or decorated styles, the font was designed from the vertical structure of an italic, based on behavior and nature of the flat round brush stroke. Salsa was developed as the final project in the postgraduate programme in Typography at the University of Buenos Aires. Functionally it can be used in titles and short texts, and has been developed with Swash Caps.",

      "description": "Display families with extensive character sets are rare for any script. With Indian typefaces, large character sets are often even less common. The Indian Type Foundry’s font families have been an exception, however. Sarpanch continues this trend. Sarpanch is an Open Source typeface supporting the Devanagari and Latin scripts. It was designed for use in large point sizes and pixel sizes. Sarpanch’s letterforms are made up of strokes with a high contrast. They are also drawn with wide proportions, based on a squared construction principle. Six fonts make up the Sarpanch family, ranging in weight from Regular to Black. As weight increases along the family’s axis, vertical strokes become thicker, but the typeface’s horizontals retain the same thickness across each weight. While the rather wide Regular weight of the family is almost monolinear, the Black weight appears to have a very high degree of contrast. The Regular, Medium and Semibold fonts are recommended for use in short headlines, while Bold, Heavy and Black are intended primarily for setting single words or pairs. At display sizes, Sarpanch works equally well on screen or in print. Each font contains 1035 glyphs and offers full support for the conjuncts and ligatures required by languages written in the Devanagari script. The Medium–Black weights of the Sarpanch family were design by Manushi Parikh at ITF in 2014. Jyotish Sonowal designed the Regular weight. Sarpanch is an excellent choice for use in advertising or for news tickers on television screens (breaking news, etc.) In Hindi, the word Sarpanch means ‘the head of a village’.",

The Secular letterforms work equally well when used at large sizes where the delicate and eccentric elements are revealed, making it useful for branding purposes as well as typsetting long-form texts. The June 2023 update features a bigger glyphset and some small fixes. The Secular project is led by Michal Sahar, a type designer based in Tel Aviv, Israel.

In the three or four years prior to the initial development of this font in June 2015, Jonny lived in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, working for Indian Type Foundry. During this time India had a profound effect on his design philosophy and general worldview. Shrikhand is the culmination of three years absorbing the colourful and vibrant hand-painted lettering that can be seen on the streets in Gujarat. Big, bold, and unapologetic, Shrikhand is a display type that evolved from discussions with colleagues about how good the Gujarati script looks when it is free to be as curvaceous and expressive as possible.

She was a model for Sandro Botticelli's painting 'The Birth of Venus' and many of his other female characters. The Simonetta font is inspired by Italian Humanistic typefaces, but it is contemporary and has many original features. It has one-sided serifs and soft drops, is slightly slanted (some two degrees) and the Italics have the same slant. The Romans and Italics differ from each other only in their shapes, with the italics being much more calligraphic and angular. Designed by Gayaneh Bagdasaryan for Brownfox.

The fonts now include two custom axes: Scanlines , which allows control of the height of the lines and, as a result of this, the amount of vertical space between the lines. And Bleed to change the amount of horizontal bleed of the pixels due to the phosphor latency found in CRT displays. Due to this project's specificity and the fonts' historical origin, they only support a limited set of glyphs. To contribute, see github.com/jenskutilek/homecomputer-fonts",

      "description": "This font was developed by the Documenting Judeo-Spanish Project . Documenting Judeo-Spanish is a digital humanities project that began in 2019 under the leadership of Dr. Bryan Kirschen. Recalling his initial fascination with Solitreo and the limited resources available to learn this script, Dr. Kirschen decided to focus this project on the cursive variety that was once common to speakers of Judeo-Spanish around the world. A nearly-extinct alphabet to an endangered language, this style of writing can be found in documents ranging from journal entries and ledgers to personal correspondence and community minutes. Many of these very documents are sitting in basements and attics today and, to the untrained eye, are mistaken for Hebrew. Judeo-Spanish (Ladino) refers to the variety of Spanish that developed among Jewish populations who were expelled from Spain in 1492 and subsequently settled throughout Turkey and the Balkans, then of the Ottoman Empire. These Jews, known as Sephardim, preserved many features of Medieval (varieties of) Spanish, while incorporating linguistic elements from the languages spoken in their surroundings, including: Turkish, Greek, Serbo-Croatian, French, Italian, and Arabic. As a Jewish language, the Spanish of the Sephardim has always been in contact with Hebrew. And while Judeo-Spanish may sound like other Romance languages, in writing, it would have traditionally appeared more similar to a Semitic language. Solitreo refers to the Hebrew-based cursive script once used by Sephardim; it is the cursive variety of the Rashi alphabet. Solitreo, or Soletreo, is derived from Galician/Portuguese, meaning ‘to spell.’ For many Sephardim, Solitreo was simply known as ganchos, meaning ‘hooks,’ due to the ligatures that form between letters. This style of writing is distinct from the Ashkenazi-based alphabet used for cursive Hebrew today, making documents in Solitreo undecipherable to the untrained eye. A similar style of writing can also be found in documents written in Judeo-Arabic. Today, Solitreo is a relic of the past, as most writers of the language utilize Roman characters. Most non-Hebrew glyphs in this font were forked from Kalam . To contribute, see github.com/ladinoprojects/solitreo .",

Source Code preserves the design features and vertical proportions of Source Sans, but alters the glyph widths so that they are uniform across all glyphs and weights. Although this family was designed specifically for coding environments, for which a regular weight will typically suffice, Source Code has been made available in the same weight range as the corresponding Source Sans design.Source Code Pro currently supports a wide range of languages using the Latin script, and includes all the characters in the Adobe Latin 4 glyph set. As an open source project, it is expected that incremental updates will be made over time to extend glyph set coverage and functionality. In 2019, we have updated the family to Roman v2.030 and Italic v1.050 . This update now supports Greek, Cyrillic, Vietnamese and Italic styles.

      "description": "Source Serif 4 is a serif typeface in the transitional style, designed to complement the Source Sans 3 family. The close companionship of Serif and Sans is achieved by a careful match of letter proportions and typographic color. Source Serif is loosely based on the work of Pierre Simon Fournier, and many idiosyncrasies typical to Fournier’s designs (like the bottom serif on the b or the middle serif on the w) are also found in Source Serif. Without being a pure historical revival, Source Serif takes cues from Fournier and reworks them for a modern age. Both typeface families have different personalities because they spring from the hands of different designers: Source Serif was designed by Frank Grießhammer, Source Sans was designed by Paul Hunt. Robert Slimbach consulted on both designs, which helped maintain the overall family harmony. Either design feels confident on its own but also works in combination with the other — just like their designers do. Source Serif continues Adobe’s line of high-quality open source typefaces . Designed for a digital environment, the letter shapes are simplified and highly readable. Its historical roots, combined with expert guidance give the typeface a strong character of its own that will shine when used for extended text on paper or screen. Source Serif is an active Open Source project – if you are interested in contributing, for more information please visit github.com/adobe/source-serif-pro",

Stoke's low x height make it most suitable for use at medium to large sizes. Stoke is a Unicode typeface family that supports languages that use the Latin script and its variants, and could be expanded to support other scripts. More specifically, this release supports the following Unicode ranges: Latin-1, Latin-2: Eastern Europe, Turkish, Macintosh Character Set. Stoke was updated in July 2012 with a slightly darker regular weight to allow ttfautohint to create high quality hinting for Windows. The optimization of the design for screen rendering involved changes to glyph sizes, letter spacing, and serif where bends were reduced to solve rendering problem in Windows XP. The character set was also expanded. Source files are available from Google Code . To contribute to the project contact Eben Sorkin .",

The Latin counterpart is derived from Lora by Olga Karpushina, Cyreal. Its vertical and horizontal metrics are adjusted to better match with the Devanagari. The meaning of Sumana in Sanskrit is flower, which is the meaning of Lora in Spanish. It was quite a challenge to match the graphical characteristics of each script and took many iterations to finalise the first release. I tried to keep the Devanagari closer to a traditional Indian calligraphic model while flavouring it with graphic solutions derived from Lora's Latin. It is my first attempt to design a Devanagari, and I am thankful to Google Fonts for making this project happen, and to all experts who consulted with me on this project, including: Fiona Ross, Eric McLaughlin, Vaishnavi Murthy, Pria Ravichandran, and Wei Huang. The comments and revision history can be found in this discussion in the Google Fonts forum .

      "description": "The Syne family was originally designed in 2017 for the Art Center \"Synesthésie\", based in Saint-Denis — a suburb of Paris. The Art Center aims to gather diverse artistic personalities in order to create new and enriching situations. Based on that idea, Syne is an exploration of atypical associations of weights and styles. Syne Tactile shares its x-height and optical weight with Syne Regular. The unusual exercice of trackpad-calligraphy, in association with handwriting models from the Renaissance, gives the font a rough yet flourished look.

      "description": "Taviraj is a serif Latin and looped Thai typeface that has a wide structure that ensures readability and legibility. It is well-suited for formal usage. Thai letters have thick and thin strokes, similar to the Latin, together with rounded and airy looped terminals. Taviraj is a 9 weight family that includes italics. Taviraj is a Thai word that refers to the last two kings of Krungsri Ayutthaya, the former capital of Thailand. People also metaphorically refer to Taviraj as the fall of a dynasty, and that is the reason why it appeared in the poem written by King Rama V regarding the situation of Siam being threatened by French expansionism, with his majesty expressing his sorrow towards the possibility of the end of his era. A traditional Thai style of typeface is called &#8220;farangses,&#8221; which means french, and Taviraj is in this genre. This contradiction highlights its origin. A similarity between some glyphs such as ก ถ ภ ฤ ฦ and ฎ ฏ is something to take into consideration because it might lead to confusion when typesetting very short texts. Taviraj takes a specific approach when dealing with the thick and thin strokes of Thai glyphs. Other type designers of Thai fonts may like to use this approach as a reference. Formal looped Thai typefaces have delicate details so care must be taken when expanding them to heavier weights, to retain all the details. The size and position of Thai vowel and tone marks has been managed carefully because they are all relevant to readability, legibility, and overall texture. The Taviraj project is led by Cadson Demak, a type foundry in Thailand. To contribute, see github.com/cadsondemak/taviraj",

This font family has been created for use in headlines and other display-sized text on screen. Five font styles make up the initial release. Display families with extensive character sets are rare for any script. With Indian typefaces, however, large character sets are even less common. ITF’s designs are an exception. The Teko typeface features letterforms with low stroke contrast, square proportions and a structure that appears visually simple. The Regular, Medium and Semibold fonts are recommended for use in long headlines, while Bold is intended primarily for setting just one or two words. The Light is a beautiful variant that may be put to exceptionally good use in large headlines on websites. At display sizes, Teko works equally well on screen or in print. Each font contains 1090 glyphs, offering full support for the conjuncts and ligatures required by languages written with the Devanagari script. Teko is an excellent choice for use in advertising or for news tickers on television screens (breaking news, etc.) Manushi Parikh designed the Teko typeface for the Indian Type Foundry, who published it in 2014. In 2023, Marc Foley converted the family to a variable font. To contribute, see github.com/googlefonts/teko .",

      "description": "Tillana is a refreshingly informal family of typefaces for Devanagari and Latin. The fonts were first published by the Indian Type Foundry as an open source project in 2014. Coming in at 1,021 glyphs per weight, Tillana has all of the characters necessary to set a variety of European languages, as well as Indian languages like Hindi, Marathi, Nepali, and more. The Tillana family includes five styles, which range in weight from Regular through Extra Bold. Tillana’s Latin do not connect; this part of the family is a non-joining script type. The Devanagari part is one of the few “true cursive” designs currently available for the script. Characters from both writing systems appear as if they were fluidly handwritten, particularly the Devanagari. Tillana’s letterforms are slanted at a 10 degree angle. The strokes are show visible contrast, and the dynamic counter forms are one of the design’s most prominent features. The forms involve many loops and hooks and most of the knots are loops rather than closed, black forms. All vertical strokes in both scripts have swelling at their tops and bottoms, and the Devanagari characters’ central vertical strokes almost always break through the headline. Handwriting artefacts are present in the Latin letters, too, such as hook on the descender of the lowercase q. Tillana’s Devanagari base character height falls vertically between the Latin upper and lowercase letter heights. The Latin characters have a small x-height and long ascenders and descenders. Lipi Raval designed the Devanagari components of Tillana, and worked together with Jonny Pinhorn on the Latin. This project is led by Indian Type Foundry, a type foundry based in Ahmedabad, Gujurat, India, who design contemporary Indian typeface families. To contribute, see github.com/itfoundry/tillana",

Any type designer interested in the amendment or revision of Titillium is invited to co-operate with us, or develop their own variants of the typeface according to the terms specified in the Open Font license. We also ask all graphic designers who use Titillium in their projects to email us some examples of the typeface family in use, in order to prepare a case histories database. Three years after the birth of Titillium, the project is still evolving, and even we don’t know what it will become in the future.

A serif Latin and looped Thai typeface, it is characterized by thick and thin strokes, and its narrow and tall structure echoes that of traditional Thai typefaces. It saves space while preserving readability and legibility with its oval-shape looped terminal. This looped Thai and Transitional serif Latin works well in formal contexts. The similarity between some glyphs such as ก ถ ภ ฤ ฦ, and ฎ and ฏ is something to take into consideration because it might lead to confusion when typesetting very short texts. Trirong takes a specific approach in how it deals with the thick and thin strokes in Thai glyphs. Other type designers of Thai fonts may like to use this approach as a reference. Formal looped Thai typefaces have delicate details, so it is important for type designers to take care when extending them into heavy weights and avoid obscuring important details. The sizes and positions of vowels and tone marks need to be managed carefully too, because they are all relevant to readability, legibility, and overall texture. The Trirong project is led by Cadson Demak, a type foundry in Thailand. To contribute, see github.com/cadsondemak/trirong",

While the glyph design of Peter Wiegel’s font has hardly been changed at all, UnifrakturCook uses smart font technologies for displaying the font’s ligatures (OpenType, Apple Advanced Typography and SIL Graphite). An experimental feature is the distinction of good blackletter typography between required ligatures ‹ch, ck, ſt, tz› that must be kept when letterspacing is increased, and regular ligatures (for instance, ‹fi, fl›) that are broken up when letterspacing is increased. Using the ligatures: Whenever you type a sequence such as ‹tz›, it will automatically be displayed as a ligature. When you want to oppress a ligature, for instance in the German word «Zeitzone» ‘time zone’ that should have no tz-ligature, then you put a zero width non-joiner between the ‹t› and the ‹z› or, alternatively, you write «Zeit&amp;zwnj;zone» in the HTML code. Unfortunately, this will only work on a browser that is capable of displaying ligatures. Of course, UnifrakturMaguntia provides the character ‹ſ› (U+017F LATIN SMALL LETTER LONG S)!

Tiny details have been simplified and the character set is reduced for the perfect balance of beautiful web typography with fast page loading. Update, April 2015: A major revision was made that adjusted the character set, OpenType features and vertical merics.

      "description": "Voces is a new graphic solution for the glyphs of the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA), considering the specific use-case of bilingual dictionaries. For this purpose, the typeface was conceived as a sans serif with gradual strokes, generous counterforms, a large \"x\" height, and short ascenders and descenders. These features attempt to solve the problems of spatial economy and print fidelity that dictionary typesetting presents. Ink traps were applied with consideration for the aesthetic and functional requirements. Voces was selected for exhibition in Tipos Latinos 2010. Voces is designed by Ana Paula Megda and Pablo Ugerman. To contribute to the project contact them at info@ugrdesign.com.ar Updated January 2016: The non-breaking space character is now empty and set to the same width as the space character.",

As a four-weight family it is well-suited for complex text environments being economic and legible, contemporary and prominent. Many of its design solutions relate to this purpose: large open counters, rather short descenders, and brutal asymmetric serifs. Spacing in Bold is slightly increased compared to the normal weight, because the bold mass is mostly grown inwards. The Italic has a steep angle and a distinctive calligraphically reminiscent character, as a counterpart to the rigorous Regular. Designed by Ivan Petrov.",

I used a variety of tools, including Gimp, Python/PIL, and of course, FontForge. The VT320 glyphs were designed with a nonrectangular pixel aspect ratio to fit the way the terminal scanned the CRT, so for this VT323 variation I had Python munge the locations and attempt to emulate the way the electron beam actually illuminated the phosphor and smeared the pixels horizontally on the terminal's CRT, so it looks more like what the actual glyph looked like on the screen. Python then drew the proper pixels into a 1:1 pixel grid as a monochrome PNG, which FontForge autoscanned into outlines. I have attempted to support most of the glyphs available on the VT320, but that is a limited set to begin with, so please don't be disappointed that I haven't supported Esperanto or Riograndenser Hunsrückisch or whatever. There is another earlier variation called \"VT321\" that uses a more standard 1:1 pixel drawing technique, if you want to grab that as well. I personally like VT323 better, and actually use it as my terminal font when cruising on the command line.",

I liked to continue the work of someone whose development was arrested at another time, to animate these characters, giving them new life through the design of a typeface that finds the balance between the old and new forms. The font was developed by Alejandro Inler in conjunction with Julieta Ulanovsky.",

The fonts now include two custom axes: Scanlines , which allows control of the height of the lines and, as a result of this, the amount of vertical space between the lines. And Bleed to change the amount of horizontal bleed of the pixels due to the phosphor latency found in CRT displays. Due to this project's specificity and the fonts' historical origin, they only support a limited set of glyphs. To contribute, see github.com/jenskutilek/homecomputer-fonts",

      "description": "Work Sans is a typeface family based loosely on early Grotesques, such as those by Stephenson Blake , Miller &amp; Richard and Bauerschen Giesserei . The Regular weight and others in the middle of the family are optimised for on-screen text usage at medium-sizes (14px-48px) and can also be used in print design. The fonts closer to the extreme weights are designed more for display use both on the web and in print. Overall, features are simplified and optimised for screen resolutions; for example, diacritic marks are larger than how they would be in print. A version optimised for desktop applications is available from the Work Sans github project page. The Work Sans project is led by Wei Huang, a type designer from Australia. To contribute, see github.com/weiweihuanghuang/Work-Sans Updated August 2015: All styles were updated to v1.40 to change the Thin (100) style to be the same as 'HairLine' in previous versions - even thinner! This avoids the complication of a second \"Hairline\" family. The ExtraLight (200) and Light (300) styles also changed accordingly. Reflow will occur from previous versions on these weights. Updated February 2020: Family has been upgraded to a variable font family.",

Its Bold is reminiscent of 1920s coffee house typography, while the rather thin fonts bridge the gap to present times. Lacking self confidence and knowledge about the type scene, Yanone decided to publish the family for free under a Creative Commons License . A decision that should turn out one of the best he ever made. It has been downloaded over 100,000 times to date, and you can witness Kaffeesatz use on German fresh-water gyms, Dubai mall promos and New Zealand McDonalds ads. And of course on coffee and foodstuff packaging and café design around the globe. In 2009 he reworked much of the typeface and it got published in FontShop&rsquo;s FontFont Library under the new name FF Kava . You can read more about it in an extensive article by Yves Peters on FontFeed . Updated in December 2013 with Cyrillic, designed by Sol Matas and Juan Pablo del Peral at Huerta Tipográfica .
